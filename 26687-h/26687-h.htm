<h2>No. 252 RUE M. LE PRINCE.</h2>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<h2><big>No. 252 Rue M. le Prince.</big></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> in May, 1886, I found myself at last in
Paris, I naturally determined to throw myself
on the charity of an old chum of mine, Eugene
Marie d'Ardeche, who had forsaken Boston a
year or more ago on receiving word of the
death of an aunt who had left him such property
as she possessed. I fancy this windfall
surprised him not a little, for the relations between
the aunt and nephew had never been
cordial, judging from Eugene's remarks touching
the lady, who was, it seems, a more or
less wicked and witch-like old person, with a
penchant for black magic, at least such was
the common report.</p>

<p>Why she should leave all her property to
d'Ardeche, no one could tell, unless it was
that she felt his rather hobbledehoy tendencies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
towards Buddhism and occultism might
some day lead him to her own unhallowed
height of questionable illumination. To be sure
d'Ardeche reviled her as a bad old woman,
being himself in that state of enthusiastic exaltation
which sometimes accompanies a boyish
fancy for occultism; but in spite of his distant
and repellent attitude, Mlle. Blaye de Tartas
made him her sole heir, to the violent wrath of
a questionable old party known to infamy as the
Sar Torrevieja, the "King of the Sorcerers."
This malevolent old portent, whose gray and
crafty face was often seen in the Rue M. le
Prince during the life of Mlle. de Tartas had,
it seems, fully expected to enjoy her small
wealth after her death; and when it appeared
that she had left him only the contents of the
gloomy old house in the Quartier Latin, giving
the house itself and all else of which she died
possessed to her nephew in America, the Sar
proceeded to remove everything from the place,
and then to curse it elaborately and comprehensively,
together with all those who should ever
dwell therein.</p>

<p>Whereupon he disappeared.</p>

<p>This final episode was the last word I received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
from Eugene, but I knew the number of the
house, 252 Rue M. le Prince. So, after a day or
two given to a first cursory survey of Paris, I
started across the Seine to find Eugene and compel
him to do the honors of the city.</p>

<p>Every one who knows the Latin Quarter knows
the Rue M. le Prince, running up the hill towards
the Garden of the Luxembourg. It is full of queer
houses and odd corners,&mdash;or was in '86,&mdash;and
certainly No. 252 was, when I found it, quite as
queer as any. It was nothing but a doorway, a
black arch of old stone between and under two
new houses painted yellow. The effect of this
bit of seventeenth-century masonry, with its dirty
old doors, and rusty broken lantern sticking
gaunt and grim out over the narrow sidewalk,
was, in its frame of fresh plaster, sinister in
the extreme.</p>

<p>I wondered if I had made a mistake in the
number; it was quite evident that no one lived
behind those cobwebs. I went into the doorway
of one of the new h&ocirc;tels and interviewed the
concierge.</p>

<p>No, M. d'Ardeche did not live there, though
to be sure he owned the mansion; he himself
resided in Meudon, in the country house of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
late Mlle. de Tartas. Would Monsieur like the
number and the street?</p>

<p>Monsieur would like them extremely, so I took
the card that the concierge wrote for me, and
forthwith started for the river, in order that I
might take a steamboat for Meudon. By one of
those coincidences which happen so often, being
quite inexplicable, I had not gone twenty paces
down the street before I ran directly into the
arms of Eugene d'Ardeche. In three minutes
we were sitting in the queer little garden of the
Chien Bleu, drinking vermouth and absinthe, and
talking it all over.</p>

<p>"You do not live in your aunt's house?" I said
at last, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"No, but if this sort of thing keeps on I shall
have to. I like Meudon much better, and the
house is perfect, all furnished, and nothing in
it newer than the last century. You must come
out with me to-night and see it. I have got a
jolly room fixed up for my Buddha. But there
is something wrong with this house opposite. I
can't keep a tenant in it,&mdash;not four days. I have
had three, all within six months, but the stories
have gone around and a man would as soon
think of hiring the Cour des Comptes to live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in as No. 252. It is notorious. The fact is,
it is haunted the worst way."</p>

<p>I laughed and ordered more vermouth.</p>

<p>"That is all right. It is haunted all the same,
or enough to keep it empty, and the funny part
is that no one knows <i>how</i> it is haunted. Nothing
is ever seen, nothing heard. As far as I
can find out, people just have the horrors there,
and have them so bad they have to go to the
hospital afterwards. I have one ex-tenant in the
Bic&ecirc;tre now. So the house stands empty, and
as it covers considerable ground and is taxed for
a lot, I don't know what to do about it. I think
I'll either give it to that child of sin, Torrevieja,
or else go and live in it myself. I shouldn't mind
the ghosts, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Did you ever stay there?"</p>

<p>"No, but I have always intended to, and in
fact I came up here to-day to see a couple of
rake-hell fellows I know, Fargeau and Duchesne,
doctors in the Clinical Hospital beyond here, up
by the Parc Mont Souris. They promised that
they would spend the night with me some time in
my aunt's house,&mdash;which is called around here,
you must know, 'la Bouche d'Enfer,'&mdash;and I
thought perhaps they would make it this week,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
if they can get off duty. Come up with me
while I see them, and then we can go across
the river to V&eacute;four's and have some luncheon,
you can get your things at the Chatham, and
we will go out to Meudon, where of course
you will spend the night with me."</p>

<p>The plan suited me perfectly, so we went up
to the hospital, found Fargeau, who declared
that he and Duchesne were ready for anything,
the nearer the real "bouche d'enfer" the better;
that the following Thursday they would both
be off duty for the night, and that on that
day they would join in an attempt to outwit the
devil and clear up the mystery of No. 252.</p>

<p>"Does M. l'Am&eacute;ricain go with us?" asked
Fargeau.</p>

<p>"Why of course," I replied, "I intend to go,
and you must not refuse me, d'Ardeche; I decline
to be put off. Here is a chance for
you to do the honors of your city in a
manner which is faultless. Show me a real
live ghost, and I will forgive Paris for having
lost the Jardin Mabille."</p>

<p>So it was settled.</p>

<p>Later we went down to Meudon and ate
dinner in the terrace room of the villa, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was all that d'Ardeche had said, and more,
so utterly was its atmosphere that of the seventeenth
century. At dinner Eugene told me
more about his late aunt, and the queer goings
on in the old house.</p>

<p>Mlle. Blaye lived, it seems, all alone, except
for one female servant of her own age; a severe,
taciturn creature, with massive Breton features
and a Breton tongue, whenever she vouchsafed
to use it. No one ever was seen to enter the
door of No. 252 except Jeanne the servant and
the Sar Torrevieja, the latter coming constantly
from none knew whither, and always entering,
<i>never leaving</i>. Indeed, the neighbors, who for
eleven years had watched the old sorcerer sidle
crab-wise up to the bell almost every day, declared
vociferously that <i>never</i> had he been seen
to leave the house. Once, when they decided to
keep absolute guard, the watcher, none other
than Ma&icirc;tre Garceau of the Chien Bleu, after
keeping his eyes fixed on the door from ten
o'clock one morning when the Sar arrived until
four in the afternoon, during which time the
door was unopened (he knew this, for had he
not gummed a ten-centime stamp over the
joint and was not the stamp unbroken) nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
fell down when the sinister figure of Torrevieja
slid wickedly by him with a dry "Pardon, Monsieur!"
and disappeared again through the black
doorway.</p>

<p>This was curious, for No. 252 was entirely
surrounded by houses, its only windows opening
on a courtyard into which no eye could look
from the h&ocirc;tels of the Rue M. le Prince and
the Rue de l'Ecole, and the mystery was one of
the choice possessions of the Latin Quarter.</p>

<p>Once a year the austerity of the place was
broken, and the denizens of the whole quarter
stood open-mouthed watching many carriages
drive up to No. 252, many of them private, not
a few with crests on the door panels, from all of
them descending veiled female figures and men
with coat collars turned up. Then followed
curious sounds of music from within, and those
whose houses joined the blank walls of No. 252
became for the moment popular, for by placing
the ear against the wall strange music could
distinctly be heard, and the sound of monotonous
chanting voices now and then. By dawn
the last guest would have departed, and for
another year the h&ocirc;tel of Mlle. de Tartas was
ominously silent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Eugene declared that he believed it was a
celebration of "Walpurgisnacht," and certainly
appearances favored such a fancy.</p>

<p>"A queer thing about the whole affair is," he
said, "the fact that every one in the street
swears that about a month ago, while I was
out in Concarneau for a visit, the music and
voices were heard again, just as when my
revered aunt was in the flesh. The house was
perfectly empty, as I tell you, so it is quite possible
that the good people were enjoying an
hallucination."</p>

<p>I must acknowledge that these stories did
not reassure me; in fact, as Thursday came
near, I began to regret a little my determination
to spend the night in the house. I was too
vain to back down, however, and the perfect
coolness of the two doctors, who ran down Tuesday
to Meudon to make a few arrangements,
caused me to swear that I would die of fright
before I would flinch. I suppose I believed
more or less in ghosts, I am sure now that I am
older I believe in them, there are in fact few
things I can <i>not</i> believe. Two or three inexplicable
things had happened to me, and, although
this was before my adventure with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Rendel in P&aelig;stum, I had a strong predisposition
to believe some things that I could not
explain, wherein I was out of sympathy with
the age.</p>

<p>Well, to come to the memorable night of the
twelfth of June, we had made our preparations,
and after depositing a big bag inside the doors
of No. 252, went across to the Chien Bleu,
where Fargeau and Duchesne turned up
promptly, and we sat down to the best dinner
P&egrave;re Garceau could create.</p>

<p>I remember I hardly felt that the conversation
was in good taste. It began with various
stories of Indian fakirs and Oriental jugglery,
matters in which Eugene was curiously well
read, swerved to the horrors of the great Sepoy
mutiny, and thus to reminiscences of the dissecting-room.
By this time we had drunk more
or less, and Duchesne launched into a photographic
and Zolaesque account of the only time
(as he said) when he was possessed of the
panic of fear; namely, one night many years
ago, when he was locked by accident into the
dissecting-room of the Loucine, together with
several cadavers of a rather unpleasant nature.
I ventured to protest mildly against the choice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of subjects, the result being a perfect carnival
of horrors, so that when we finally drank our
last <i>cr&egrave;me de cacao</i> and started for "la Bouche
d'Enfer," my nerves were in a somewhat rocky
condition.</p>

<p>It was just ten o'clock when we came into
the street. A hot dead wind drifted in great
puffs through the city, and ragged masses of
vapor swept the purple sky; an unsavory night
altogether, one of those nights of hopeless lassitude
when one feels, if one is at home, like doing
nothing but drink mint juleps and smoke cigarettes.</p>

<p>Eugene opened the creaking door, and tried
to light one of the lanterns; but the gusty wind
blew out every match, and we finally had to
close the outer doors before we could get a
light. At last we had all the lanterns going,
and I began to look around curiously. We were
in a long, vaulted passage, partly carriageway,
partly footpath, perfectly bare but for the
street refuse which had drifted in with eddying
winds. Beyond lay the courtyard, a curious
place rendered more curious still by the fitful
moonlight and the flashing of four dark lanterns.
The place had evidently been once a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
most noble palace. Opposite rose the oldest
portion, a three-story wall of the time of Francis
I., with a great wisteria vine covering half.
The wings on either side were more modern,
seventeenth century, and ugly, while towards
the street was nothing but a flat unbroken
wall.</p>

<p>The great bare court, littered with bits of
paper blown in by the wind, fragments of packing
cases, and straw, mysterious with flashing
lights and flaunting shadows, while low masses
of torn vapor drifted overhead, hiding, then
revealing the stars, and all in absolute silence,
not even the sounds of the streets entering this
prison-like place, was weird and uncanny in the
extreme. I must confess that already I began to
feel a slight disposition towards the horrors, but
with that curious inconsequence which so often
happens in the case of those who are deliberately
growing scared, I could think of nothing
more reassuring than those delicious verses of
Lewis Carroll's:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That alone should encourage the crew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What I tell you three times is true,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>which kept repeating themselves over and over
in my brain with feverish insistence.</p>

<p>Even the medical students had stopped their
chaffing, and were studying the surroundings
gravely.</p>

<p>"There is one thing certain," said Fargeau,
"<i>anything</i> might have happened here without
the slightest chance of discovery. Did ever
you see such a perfect place for lawlessness?"</p>

<p>"And <i>anything</i> might happen here now, with
the same certainty of impunity," continued
Duchesne, lighting his pipe, the snap of the
match making us all start. "D'Ardeche, your
lamented relative was certainly well fixed; she
had full scope here for her traditional experiments
in demonology."</p>

<p>"Curse me if I don't believe that those same
traditions were more or less founded on fact,"
said Eugene. "I never saw this court under
these conditions before, but I could believe anything
now. What's that!"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a door slamming," said Duchesne,
loudly.</p>

<p>"Well, I wish doors wouldn't slam in houses
that have been empty eleven months."</p>

<p>"It is irritating," and Duchesne slipped his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
arm through mine; "but we must take things
as they come. Remember we have to deal
not only with the spectral lumber left here by
your scarlet aunt, but as well with the supererogatory
curse of that hell-cat Torrevieja. Come
on! let's get inside before the hour arrives for
the sheeted dead to squeak and gibber in these
lonely halls. Light your pipes, your tobacco is
a sure protection against 'your whoreson dead
bodies'; light up and move on."</p>

<p>We opened the hall door and entered a vaulted
stone vestibule, full of dust, and cobwebby.</p>

<p>"There is nothing on this floor," said Eugene,
"except servants' rooms and offices, and I don't
believe there is anything wrong with them. I
never heard that there was, any way. Let's go
up stairs."</p>

<p>So far as we could see, the house was apparently
perfectly uninteresting inside, all eighteenth-century
work, the fa&ccedil;ade of the main
building being, with the vestibule, the only
portion of the Francis I. work.</p>

<p>"The place was burned during the Terror,"
said Eugene, "for my great-uncle, from whom
Mlle. de Tartas inherited it, was a good and true
Royalist; he went to Spain after the Revolution,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and did not come back until the accession of
Charles X., when he restored the house, and
then died, enormously old. This explains why
it is all so new."</p>

<p>The old Spanish sorcerer to whom Mlle. de
Tartas had left her personal property had done
his work thoroughly. The house was absolutely
empty, even the wardrobes and bookcases built
in had been carried away; we went through
room after room, finding all absolutely dismantled,
only the windows and doors with their
casings, the parquet floors, and the florid Renaissance
mantels remaining.</p>

<p>"I feel better," remarked Fargeau. "The house
may be haunted, but it don't look it, certainly;
it is the most respectable place imaginable."</p>

<p>"Just you wait," replied Eugene. "These are
only the state apartments, which my aunt seldom
used, except, perhaps, on her annual 'Walpurgisnacht.'
Come up stairs and I will show you
a better <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i>."</p>

<p>On this floor, the rooms fronting the court, the
sleeping-rooms, were quite small,&mdash;("They are
the bad rooms all the same," said Eugene,)&mdash;four
of them, all just as ordinary in appearance as
those below. A corridor ran behind them connecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
with the wing corridor, and from this
opened a door, unlike any of the other doors in
that it was covered with green baize, somewhat
moth-eaten. Eugene selected a key from the
bunch he carried, unlocked the door, and with
some difficulty forced it to swing inward; it was
as heavy as the door of a safe.</p>

<p>"We are now," he said, "on the very threshold
of hell itself; these rooms in here were my
scarlet aunt's unholy of unholies. I never let
them with the rest of the house, but keep them
as a curiosity. I only wish Torrevieja had kept
out; as it was, he looted them, as he did the
rest of the house, and nothing is left but the
walls and ceiling and floor. They are something,
however, and may suggest what the former
condition must have been. Tremble and
enter."</p>

<p>The first apartment was a kind of anteroom, a
cube of perhaps twenty feet each way, without
windows, and with no doors except that by which
we entered and another to the right. Walls, floor,
and ceiling were covered with a black lacquer,
brilliantly polished, that flashed the light of our
lanterns in a thousand intricate reflections. It
was like the inside of an enormous Japanese box,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and about as empty. From this we passed to
another room, and here we nearly dropped our
lanterns. The room was circular, thirty feet or
so in diameter, covered by a hemispherical dome;
walls and ceiling were dark blue, spotted with
gold stars; and reaching from floor to floor
across the dome stretched a colossal figure in
red lacquer of a nude woman kneeling, her
legs reaching out along the floor on either
side, her head touching the lintel of the door
through which we had entered, her arms forming
its sides, with the fore arms extended and
stretching along the walls until they met the
long feet. The most astounding, misshapen,
absolutely terrifying thing, I think, I ever saw.
From the navel hung a great white object, like
the traditional roe's egg of the Arabian Nights.
The floor was of red lacquer, and in it was
inlaid a pentagram the size of the room, made
of wide strips of brass. In the centre of this
pentagram was a circular disk of black stone,
slightly saucer-shaped, with a small outlet in the
middle.</p>

<p>The effect of the room was simply crushing,
with this gigantic red figure crouched over it all,
the staring eyes fixed on one, no matter what his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
position. None of us spoke, so oppressive was
the whole thing.</p>

<p>The third room was like the first in dimensions,
but instead of being black it was entirely
sheathed with plates of brass, walls, ceiling, and
floor,&mdash;tarnished now, and turning green, but
still brilliant under the lantern light. In the
middle stood an oblong altar of porphyry, its
longer dimensions on the axis of the suite of
rooms, and at one end, opposite the range of
doors, a pedestal of black basalt.</p>

<p>This was all. Three rooms, stranger than
these, even in their emptiness, it would be
hard to imagine. In Egypt, in India, they
would not be entirely out of place, but here
in Paris, in a commonplace <i>h&ocirc;tel</i>, in the Rue
M. le Prince, they were incredible.</p>

<p>We retraced our steps, Eugene closed the
iron door with its baize covering, and we went
into one of the front chambers and sat down,
looking at each other.</p>

<p>"Nice party, your aunt," said Fargeau. "Nice
old party, with amiable tastes; I am glad we are
not to spend the night in <i>those</i> rooms."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose she did there?" inquired
Duchesne. "I know more or less about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
black art, but that series of rooms is too much
for me."</p>

<p>"My impression is," said d'Ardeche, "that the
brazen room was a kind of sanctuary containing
some image or other on the basalt base, while
the stone in front was really an altar,&mdash;what the
nature of the sacrifice might be I don't even
guess. The round room may have been used
for invocations and incantations. The pentagram
looks like it. Any way it is all just
about as queer and <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> as I can well
imagine. Look here, it is nearly twelve, let's
dispose of ourselves, if we are going to hunt
this thing down."</p>

<p>The four chambers on this floor of the old
house were those said to be haunted, the
wings being quite innocent, and, so far as we
knew, the floors below. It was arranged that
we should each occupy a room, leaving the
doors open with the lights burning, and at the
slightest cry or knock we were all to rush at
once to the room from which the warning
sound might come. There was no communication
between the rooms to be sure, but, as
the doors all opened into the corridor, every
sound was plainly audible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The last room fell to me, and I looked it over
carefully.</p>

<p>It seemed innocent enough, a commonplace,
square, rather lofty Parisian sleeping-room,
finished in wood painted white, with a small
marble mantel, a dusty floor of inlaid maple
and cherry, walls hung with an ordinary French
paper, apparently quite new, and two deeply embrasured
windows looking out on the court.</p>

<p>I opened the swinging sash with some trouble,
and sat down in the window seat with my lantern
beside me trained on the only door, which
gave on the corridor.</p>

<p>The wind had gone down, and it was very
still without,&mdash;still and hot. The masses of
luminous vapor were gathering thickly overhead,
no longer urged by the gusty wind. The
great masses of rank wisteria leaves, with here
and there a second blossoming of purple flowers,
hung dead over the window in the sluggish air.
Across the roofs I could hear the sound of a
belated <i>fiacre</i> in the streets below. I filled my
pipe again and waited.</p>

<p>For a time the voices of the men in the
other rooms were a companionship, and at first
I shouted to them now and then, but my voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
echoed rather unpleasantly through the long
corridors, and had a suggestive way of reverberating
around the left wing beside me, and
coming out at a broken window at its extremity
like the voice of another man. I soon
gave up my attempts at conversation, and devoted
myself to the task of keeping awake.</p>

<p>It was not easy; why did I eat that lettuce
salad at P&egrave;re Garceau's? I should have known
better. It was making me irresistibly sleepy,
and wakefulness was absolutely necessary. It
was certainly gratifying to know that I could
sleep, that my courage was by me to that extent,
but in the interests of science I must keep
awake. But almost never, it seemed, had sleep
looked so desirable. Half a hundred times,
nearly, I would doze for an instant, only to
awake with a start, and find my pipe gone out.
Nor did the exertion of relighting it pull me together.
I struck my match mechanically, and
with the first puff dropped off again. It was
most vexing. I got up and walked around the
room. It was most annoying. My cramped
position had almost put both my legs to sleep.
I could hardly stand. I felt numb, as though
with cold. There was no longer any sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
from the other rooms, nor from without. I
sank down in my window seat. How dark it
was growing! I turned up the lantern. That
pipe again, how obstinately it kept going out!
and my last match was gone. The lantern, too,
was <i>that</i> going out? I lifted my hand to turn it
up again. It felt like lead, and fell beside me.</p>

<p><i>Then</i> I awoke,&mdash;absolutely. I remembered
the story of "The Haunters and the Haunted."
<i>This</i> was the Horror. I tried to rise, to cry
out. My body was like lead, my tongue was
paralyzed. I could hardly move my eyes. And
the light was going out. There was no question
about that. Darker and darker yet; little
by little the pattern of the paper was swallowed
up in the advancing night. A prickling numbness
gathered in every nerve, my right arm
slipped without feeling from my lap to my side,
and I could not raise it,&mdash;it swung helpless. A
thin, keen humming began in my head, like
the cicadas on a hillside in September. The
darkness was coming fast.</p>

<p>Yes, this was it. Something was subjecting
me, body and mind, to slow paralysis. Physically
I was already dead. If I could only hold
my mind, my consciousness, I might still be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
safe, but could I? Could I resist the mad horror
of this silence, the deepening dark, the
creeping numbness? I knew that, like the
man in the ghost story, my only safety lay here.</p>

<p>It had come at last. My body was dead, I
could no longer move my eyes. They were
fixed in that last look on the place where the
door had been, now only a deepening of the
dark.</p>

<p>Utter night: the last flicker of the lantern
was gone. I sat and waited; my mind was
still keen, but how long would it last? There
was a limit even to the endurance of the utter
panic of fear.</p>

<p>Then the end began. In the velvet blackness
came two white eyes, milky, opalescent,
small, far away,&mdash;awful eyes, like a dead dream.
More beautiful than I can describe, the flakes
of white flame moving from the perimeter inward,
disappearing in the centre, like a never
ending flow of opal water into a circular tunnel.
I could not have moved my eyes had I possessed
the power: they devoured the fearful,
beautiful things that grew slowly, slowly larger,
fixed on me, advancing, growing more beautiful,
the white flakes of light sweeping more swiftly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
into the blazing vortices, the awful fascination
deepening in its insane intensity as the white,
vibrating eyes grew nearer, larger.</p>

<p>Like a hideous and implacable engine of
death the eyes of the unknown Horror swelled
and expanded until they were close before me,
enormous, terrible, and I felt a slow, cold, wet
breath propelled with mechanical regularity
against my face, enveloping me in its fetid mist,
in its charnel-house deadliness.</p>

<p>With ordinary fear goes always a physical
terror, but with me in the presence of this unspeakable
Thing was only the utter and awful
terror of the mind, the mad fear of a prolonged
and ghostly nightmare. Again and again I
tried to shriek, to make some noise, but physically
I was utterly dead. I could only feel
myself go mad with the terror of hideous death.
The eyes were close on me,&mdash;their movement
so swift that they seemed to be but palpitating
flames, the dead breath was around me like the
depths of the deepest sea.</p>

<p>Suddenly a wet, icy mouth, like that of a
dead cuttle-fish, shapeless, jelly-like, fell over
mine. The horror began slowly to draw my
life from me, but, as enormous and shuddering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
folds of palpitating jelly swept sinuously around
me, my will came back, my body awoke with
the reaction of final fear, and I closed with the
nameless death that enfolded me.</p>

<p>What was it that I was fighting? My arms
sunk through the unresisting mass that was
turning me to ice. Moment by moment new
folds of cold jelly swept round me, crushing me
with the force of Titans. I fought to wrest my
mouth from this awful Thing that sealed it, but,
if ever I succeeded and caught a single breath,
the wet, sucking mass closed over my face
again before I could cry out. I think I fought
for hours, desperately, insanely, in a silence
that was more hideous than any sound,&mdash;fought
until I felt final death at hand, until the memory
of all my life rushed over me like a flood, until
I no longer had strength to wrench my face
from that hellish succubus, until with a last
mechanical struggle I fell and yielded to death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then I heard a voice say, "If he is dead, I
can never forgive myself; I was to blame."</p>

<p>Another replied, "He is not dead, I know we
can save him if only we reach the hospital in
time. Drive like hell, <i>cocher</i>! twenty francs
for you, if you get there in three minutes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there was night again, and nothingness,
until I suddenly awoke and stared around. I
lay in a hospital ward, very white and sunny,
some yellow <i>fleurs-de-lis</i> stood beside the head
of the pallet, and a tall sister of mercy sat by
my side.</p>

<p>To tell the story in a few words, I was in the
H&ocirc;tel Dieu, where the men had taken me that
fearful night of the twelfth of June. I asked
for Fargeau or Duchesne, and by and by the
latter came, and sitting beside the bed told me
all that I did not know.</p>

<p>It seems that they had sat, each in his room,
hour after hour, hearing nothing, very much
bored, and disappointed. Soon after two
o'clock Fargeau, who was in the next room,
called to me to ask if I was awake. I gave no
reply, and, after shouting once or twice, he took
his lantern and came to investigate. The door
was locked on the inside! He instantly called
d'Ardeche and Duchesne, and together they
hurled themselves against the door. It resisted.
Within they could hear irregular footsteps dashing
here and there, with heavy breathing. Although
frozen with terror, they fought to destroy
the door and finally succeeded by using a great
slab of marble that formed the shelf of the mantel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
in Fargeau's room. As the door crashed in,
they were suddenly hurled back against the
walls of the corridor, as though by an explosion,
the lanterns were extinguished, and they found
themselves in utter silence and darkness.</p>

<p>As soon as they recovered from the shock,
they leaped into the room and fell over my body
in the middle of the floor. They lighted one
of the lanterns, and saw the strangest sight that
can be imagined. The floor and walls to the
height of about six feet were running with something
that seemed like stagnant water, thick,
glutinous, sickening. As for me, I was drenched
with the same cursed liquid. The odor of
musk was nauseating. They dragged me
away, stripped off my clothing, wrapped me in
their coats, and hurried to the hospital, thinking
me perhaps dead. Soon after sunrise
d'Ardeche left the hospital, being assured that
I was in a fair way to recovery, with time, and
with Fargeau went up to examine by daylight
the traces of the adventure that was so nearly
fatal. They were too late. Fire engines were
coming down the street as they passed the Acad&eacute;mie.
A neighbor rushed up to d'Ardeche:
"O Monsieur! what misfortune, yet what fortune!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
It is true <i>la Bouche d'Enfer</i>&mdash;I beg
pardon, the residence of the lamented Mlle. de
Tartas,&mdash;was burned, but not wholly, only the
ancient building. The wings were saved, and
for that great credit is due the brave firemen.
Monsieur will remember them, no doubt."</p>

<p>It was quite true. Whether a forgotten lantern,
overturned in the excitement, had done the
work, or whether the origin of the fire was more
supernatural, it was certain that "the Mouth of
Hell" was no more. A last engine was pumping
slowly as d'Ardeche came up; half a dozen
limp, and one distended, hose stretched through
the <i>porte coch&egrave;re</i>, and within only the fa&ccedil;ade of
Francis I. remained, draped still with the black
stems of the wisteria. Beyond lay a great
vacancy, where thin smoke was rising slowly.
Every floor was gone, and the strange halls of
Mlle. Blaye de Tartas were only a memory.</p>

<p>With d'Ardeche I visited the place last
year, but in the stead of the ancient walls was
then only a new and ordinary building, fresh
and respectable; yet the wonderful stories of
the old <i>Bouche d'Enfer</i> still lingered in the quarter,
and will hold there, I do not doubt, until the
Day of Judgment.</p>

<h2>IN KROPFSBERG KEEP.</h2>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<h2><big>In Kropfsberg Keep.</big></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the traveller from Innsbr&uuml;ck to Munich, up
the lovely valley of the silver Inn, many castles
appear, one after another, each on its beetling
cliff or gentle hill,&mdash;appear and disappear, melting
into the dark fir trees that grow so thickly
on every side,&mdash;Laneck, Lichtwer, Ratholtz,
Tratzberg, Matzen, Kropfsberg, gathering close
around the entrance to the dark and wonderful
Zillerthal.</p>

<p>But to us&mdash;Tom Rendel and myself&mdash;there
are two castles only: not the gorgeous and
princely Ambras, nor the noble old Tratzberg,
with its crowded treasures of solemn and splendid
medi&aelig;valism; but little Matzen, where
eager hospitality forms the new life of a never-dead
chivalry, and Kropfsberg, ruined, tottering,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
blasted by fire and smitten with grievous years,&mdash;a
dead thing, and haunted,&mdash;full of strange
legends, and eloquent of mystery and tragedy.</p>

<p>We were visiting the von C&mdash;&mdash;s at Matzen,
and gaining our first wondering knowledge of
the courtly, cordial castle life in the Tyrol,&mdash;of
the gentle and delicate hospitality of noble Austrians.
Brixleg had ceased to be but a mark on
a map, and had become a place of rest and delight,
a home for homeless wanderers on the
face of Europe, while Schloss Matzen was a
synonym for all that was gracious and kindly
and beautiful in life. The days moved on in a
golden round of riding and driving and shooting:
down to Landl and Thiersee for chamois,
across the river to the magic Achensee, up the
Zillerthal, across the Schmerner Joch, even to
the railway station at Steinach. And in the
evenings after the late dinners in the upper
hall where the sleepy hounds leaned against
our chairs looking at us with suppliant eyes,
in the evenings when the fire was dying away
in the hooded fireplace in the library, stories.
Stories, and legends, and fairy tales, while the
stiff old portraits changed countenance constantly
under the flickering firelight, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
sound of the drifting Inn came softly across
the meadows far below.</p>

<p>If ever I tell the Story of Schloss Matzen,
then will be the time to paint the too inadequate
picture of this fair oasis in the desert of
travel and tourists and hotels; but just now it
is Kropfsberg the Silent that is of greater importance,
for it was only in Matzen that the
story was told by Fr&auml;ulein E&mdash;&mdash;, the gold-haired
niece of Frau von C&mdash;&mdash;, one hot evening in July,
when we were sitting in the great west window
of the drawing-room after a long ride up the
Stallenthal. All the windows were open to
catch the faint wind, and we had sat for a long
time watching the Otzethaler Alps turn rose-color
over distant Innsbr&uuml;ck, then deepen to
violet as the sun went down and the white
mists rose slowly until Lichtwer and Laneck
and Kropfsberg rose like craggy islands in a
silver sea.</p>

<p>And this is the story as Fr&auml;ulein E&mdash;&mdash; told
it to us,&mdash;the Story of Kropfsberg Keep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A great many years ago, soon after my grandfather
died, and Matzen came to us, when I
was a little girl, and so young that I remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
nothing of the affair except as something dreadful
that frightened me very much, two young
men who had studied painting with my grandfather
came down to Brixleg from Munich,
partly to paint, and partly to amuse themselves,&mdash;"ghost-hunting"
as they said, for they were
very sensible young men and prided themselves
on it, laughing at all kinds of "superstition,"
and particularly at that form which believed in
ghosts and feared them. They had never seen
a real ghost, you know, and they belonged to a
certain set of people who believed nothing they
had not seen themselves,&mdash;which always seemed
to me <i>very</i> conceited. Well, they knew that we
had lots of beautiful castles here in the "lower
valley," and they assumed, and rightly, that
every castle has at least <i>one</i> ghost story connected
with it, so they chose this as their hunting
ground, only the game they sought was
ghosts, not chamois. Their plan was to visit
every place that was supposed to be haunted,
and to meet every reputed ghost, and prove that
it really was no ghost at all.</p>

<p>There was a little inn down in the village then,
kept by an old man named Peter Rosskopf, and
the two young men made this their headquarters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
The very first night they began to draw from
the old innkeeper all that he knew of legends
and ghost stories connected with Brixleg and
its castles, and as he was a most garrulous old
gentleman he filled them with the wildest delight
by his stories of the ghosts of the castles about
the mouth of the Zillerthal. Of course the old
man believed every word he said, and you can
imagine his horror and amazement when, after
telling his guests the particularly blood-curdling
story of Kropfsberg and its haunted keep, the
elder of the two boys, whose surname I have forgotten,
but whose Christian name was Rupert,
calmly said, "Your story is most satisfactory:
we will sleep in Kropfsberg Keep to-morrow
night, and you must provide us with all that
we may need to make ourselves comfortable."</p>

<p>The old man nearly fell into the fire. "What
for a blockhead are you?" he cried, with big
eyes. "The keep is haunted by Count Albert's
ghost, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"That is why we are going there to-morrow
night; we wish to make the acquaintance of
Count Albert."</p>

<p>"But there was a man stayed there once, and
in the morning he was dead."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very silly of him; there are two of us, and
we carry revolvers."</p>

<p>"But it's a <i>ghost</i>, I tell you," almost screamed
the innkeeper; "are ghosts afraid of firearms?"</p>

<p>"Whether they are or not, we are <i>not</i> afraid
of <i>them</i>."</p>

<p>Here the younger boy broke in,&mdash;he was
named Otto von Kleist. I remember the name,
for I had a music teacher once by that name.
He abused the poor old man shamefully; told
him that they were going to spend the night in
Kropfsberg in spite of Count Albert and Peter
Rosskopf, and that he might as well make the
most of it and earn his money with cheerfulness.</p>

<p>In a word, they finally bullied the old fellow
into submission, and when the morning came
he set about preparing for the suicide, as he
considered it, with sighs and mutterings and
ominous shakings of the head.</p>

<p>You know the condition of the castle now,&mdash;nothing
but scorched walls and crumbling piles
of fallen masonry. Well, at the time I tell you
of, the keep was still partially preserved. It was
finally burned out only a few years ago by some
wicked boys who came over from Jenbach to
have a good time. But when the ghost hunters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
came, though the two lower floors had fallen
into the crypt, the third floor remained. The
peasants said it <i>could</i> not fall, but that it would
stay until the Day of Judgment, because it was
in the room above that the wicked Count Albert
sat watching the flames destroy the great castle
and his imprisoned guests, and where he finally
hung himself in a suit of armor that had belonged
to his medi&aelig;val ancestor, the first Count
Kropfsberg.</p>

<p>No one dared touch him, and so he hung
there for twelve years, and all the time venturesome
boys and daring men used to creep up
the turret steps and stare awfully through the
chinks in the door at that ghostly mass of
steel that held within itself the body of a murderer
and suicide, slowly returning to the dust
from which it was made. Finally it disappeared,
none knew whither, and for another dozen years
the room stood empty but for the old furniture
and the rotting hangings.</p>

<p>So, when the two men climbed the stairway to
the haunted room, they found a very different
state of things from what exists now. The room
was absolutely as it was left the night Count
Albert burned the castle, except that all trace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of the suspended suit of armor and its ghastly
contents had vanished.</p>

<p>No one had dared to cross the threshold, and
I suppose that for forty years no living thing had
entered that dreadful room.</p>

<p>On one side stood a vast canopied bed of
black wood, the damask hangings of which
were covered with mould and mildew. All the
clothing of the bed was in perfect order, and on
it lay a book, open, and face downward. The
only other furniture in the room consisted of
several old chairs, a carved oak chest, and a big
inlaid table covered with books and papers, and
on one corner two or three bottles with dark
solid sediment at the bottom, and a glass, also
dark with the dregs of wine that had been poured
out almost half a century before. The tapestry
on the walls was green with mould, but hardly
torn or otherwise defaced, for although the heavy
dust of forty years lay on everything the room
had been preserved from further harm. No
spider web was to be seen, no trace of nibbling
mice, not even a dead moth or fly on the
sills of the diamond-paned windows; life seemed
to have shunned the room utterly and finally.</p>

<p>The men looked at the room curiously, and, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
am sure, not without some feelings of awe and
unacknowledged fear; but, whatever they may
have felt of instinctive shrinking, they said
nothing, and quickly set to work to make the
room passably inhabitable. They decided to
touch nothing that had not absolutely to be
changed, and therefore they made for themselves
a bed in one corner with the mattress
and linen from the inn. In the great fireplace
they piled a lot of wood on the caked ashes of
a fire dead for forty years, turned the old chest
into a table, and laid out on it all their arrangements
for the evening's amusement: food, two
or three bottles of wine, pipes and tobacco, and
the chess-board that was their inseparable travelling
companion.</p>

<p>All this they did themselves: the innkeeper
would not even come within the walls of the
outer court; he insisted that he had washed
his hands of the whole affair, the silly dunderheads
might go to their death their own way.
<i>He</i> would not aid and abet them. One of
the stable boys brought the basket of food
and the wood and the bed up the winding
stone stairs, to be sure, but neither money nor
prayers nor threats would bring him within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the walls of the accursed place, and he stared
fearfully at the hare-brained boys as they worked
around the dead old room preparing for the night
that was coming so fast.</p>

<p>At length everything was in readiness, and
after a final visit to the inn for dinner Rupert
and Otto started at sunset for the Keep. Half
the village went with them, for Peter Rosskopf
had babbled the whole story to an open-mouthed
crowd of wondering men and women, and as to
an execution the awe-struck crowd followed the
two boys dumbly, curious to see if they surely
would put their plan into execution. But none
went farther than the outer doorway of the stairs,
for it was already growing twilight. In absolute
silence they watched the two foolhardy youths
with their lives in their hands enter the terrible
Keep, standing like a tower in the midst of the
piles of stones that had once formed walls joining
it with the mass of the castle beyond. When
a moment later a light showed itself in the high
windows above, they sighed resignedly and went
their ways, to wait stolidly until morning should
come and prove the truth of their fears and
warnings.</p>

<p>In the mean time the ghost hunters built a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
huge fire, lighted their many candles, and sat
down to await developments. Rupert afterwards
told my uncle that they really felt no fear whatever,
only a contemptuous curiosity, and they
ate their supper with good appetite and an unusual
relish. It was a long evening. They
played many games of chess, waiting for midnight.
Hour passed after hour, and nothing
occurred to interrupt the monotony of the evening.
Ten, eleven, came and went,&mdash;it was
almost midnight. They piled more wood in
the fireplace, lighted new candles, looked to
their pistols&mdash;and waited. The clocks in the
village struck twelve; the sound coming muffled
through the high, deep-embrasured windows.
Nothing happened, nothing to break the heavy
silence; and with a feeling of disappointed
relief they looked at each other and acknowledged
that they had met another rebuff.</p>

<p>Finally they decided that there was no use in
sitting up and boring themselves any longer,
they had much better rest; so Otto threw himself
down on the mattress, falling almost immediately
asleep. Rupert sat a little longer,
smoking, and watching the stars creep along
behind the shattered glass and the bent leads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of the lofty windows; watching the fire fall
together, and the strange shadows move mysteriously
on the mouldering walls. The iron
hook in the oak beam, that crossed the ceiling
midway, fascinated him, not with fear, but
morbidly. So, it was from that hook that for
twelve years, twelve long years of changing
summer and winter, the body of Count Albert,
murderer and suicide, hung in its strange casing
of medi&aelig;val steel; moving a little at first, and
turning gently while the fire died out on the
hearth, while the ruins of the castle grew cold,
and horrified peasants sought for the bodies of
the score of gay, reckless, wicked guests whom
Count Albert had gathered in Kropfsberg for
a last debauch, gathered to their terrible and
untimely death. What a strange and fiendish
idea it was, the young, handsome noble who
had ruined himself and his family in the society
of the splendid debauchees, gathering them all
together, men and women who had known only
love and pleasure, for a glorious and awful riot
of luxury, and then, when they were all dancing
in the great ballroom, locking the doors and
burning the whole castle about them, the while
he sat in the great keep listening to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
screams of agonized fear, watching the fire
sweep from wing to wing until the whole mighty
mass was one enormous and awful pyre, and
then, clothing himself in his great-great-grandfather's
armor, hanging himself in the midst
of the ruins of what had been a proud and
noble castle. So ended a great family, a great
house.</p>

<p>But that was forty years ago.</p>

<p>He was growing drowsy; the light flickered
and flared in the fireplace; one by one the candles
went out; the shadows grew thick in the
room. Why did that great iron hook stand out
so plainly? why did that dark shadow dance
and quiver so mockingly behind it?&mdash;why&mdash; But
he ceased to wonder at anything. He was
asleep.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he woke almost immediately;
the fire still burned, though low
and fitfully on the hearth. Otto was sleeping,
breathing quietly and regularly; the shadows
had gathered close around him, thick and
murky; with every passing moment the light
died in the fireplace; he felt stiff with cold.
In the utter silence he heard the clock in the
village strike two. He shivered with a sudden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and irresistible feeling of fear, and abruptly
turned and looked towards the hook in the
ceiling.</p>

<p>Yes, It was there. He knew that It would
be. It seemed quite natural, he would have
been disappointed had he seen nothing; but
now he knew that the story was true, knew that
he was wrong, and that the dead <i>do</i> sometimes
return to earth, for there, in the fast-deepening
shadow, hung the black mass of wrought steel,
turning a little now and then, with the light
flickering on the tarnished and rusty metal.
He watched it quietly; he hardly felt afraid;
it was rather a sentiment of sadness and fatality
that filled him, of gloomy forebodings
of something unknown, unimaginable. He sat
and watched the thing disappear in the gathering
dark, his hand on his pistol as it lay by him
on the great chest. There was no sound but
the regular breathing of the sleeping boy on the
mattress.</p>

<p>It had grown absolutely dark; a bat fluttered
against the broken glass of the window. He
wondered if he was growing mad, for&mdash;he hesitated
to acknowledge it to himself&mdash;he heard
music; far, curious music, a strange and luxurious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
dance, very faint, very vague, but unmistakable.</p>

<p>Like a flash of lightning came a jagged line
of fire down the blank wall opposite him, a line
that remained, that grew wider, that let a pale
cold light into the room, showing him now all
its details,&mdash;the empty fireplace, where a thin
smoke rose in a spiral from a bit of charred
wood, the mass of the great bed, and, in the
very middle, black against the curious brightness,
the armored man, or ghost, or devil, standing,
not suspended, beneath the rusty hook.
And with the rending of the wall the music
grew more distinct, though sounding still very,
very far away.</p>

<p>Count Albert raised his mailed hand and
beckoned to him; then turned, and stood in
the riven wall.</p>

<p>Without a word, Rupert rose and followed
him, his pistol in hand. Count Albert passed
through the mighty wall and disappeared in
the unearthly light. Rupert followed mechanically.
He felt the crushing of the mortar
beneath his feet, the roughness of the jagged
wall where he rested his hand to steady
himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The keep rose absolutely isolated among the
ruins, yet on passing through the wall Rupert
found himself in a long, uneven corridor, the
floor of which was warped and sagging, while
the walls were covered on one side with big
faded portraits of an inferior quality, like those
in the corridor that connects the Pitti and Uffizzi
in Florence. Before him moved the figure of
Count Albert,&mdash;a black silhouette in the ever-increasing
light. And always the music grew
stronger and stranger, a mad, evil, seductive
dance that bewitched even while it disgusted.</p>

<p>In a final blaze of vivid, intolerable light, in
a burst of hellish music that might have come
from Bedlam, Rupert stepped from the corridor
into a vast and curious room where at
first he saw nothing, distinguished nothing but
a mad, seething whirl of sweeping figures,
white, in a white room, under white light,
Count Albert standing before him, the only
dark object to be seen. As his eyes grew
accustomed to the fearful brightness, he knew
that he was looking on a dance such as the
damned might see in hell, but such as no living
man had ever seen before.</p>

<p>Around the long, narrow hall, under the fearful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
light that came from nowhere, but was omnipresent,
swept a rushing stream of unspeakable
horrors, dancing insanely, laughing, gibbering
hideously; the dead of forty years. White,
polished skeletons, bare of flesh and vesture,
skeletons clothed in the dreadful rags of dried
and rattling sinews, the tags of tattering grave-clothes
flaunting behind them. These were the
dead of many years ago. Then the dead of more
recent times, with yellow bones showing only
here and there, the long and insecure hair of
their hideous heads writhing in the beating
air. Then green and gray horrors, bloated
and shapeless, stained with earth or dripping
with spattering water; and here and there
white, beautiful things, like chiselled ivory, the
dead of yesterday, locked it may be, in the
mummy arms of rattling skeletons.</p>

<p>Round and round the cursed room, a swaying,
swirling maelstrom of death, while the air grew
thick with miasma, the floor foul with shreds of
shrouds, and yellow parchment, clattering bones,
and wisps of tangled hair.</p>

<p>And in the very midst of this ring of death, a
sight not for words nor for thought, a sight to
blast forever the mind of the man who looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
upon it: a leaping, writhing dance of Count
Albert's victims, the score of beautiful women
and reckless men who danced to their awful
death while the castle burned around them,
charred and shapeless now, a living charnel-house
of nameless horror.</p>

<p>Count Albert, who had stood silent and
gloomy, watching the dance of the damned,
turned to Rupert, and for the first time spoke.</p>

<p>"We are ready for you now; dance!"</p>

<p>A prancing horror, dead some dozen years,
perhaps, flaunted from the rushing river of
the dead, and leered at Rupert with eyeless
skull.</p>

<p>"Dance!"</p>

<p>Rupert stood frozen, motionless.</p>

<p>"Dance!"</p>

<p>His hard lips moved. "Not if the devil came
from hell to make me."</p>

<p>Count Albert swept his vast two-handed
sword into the f&#339;tid air while the tide of
corruption paused in its swirling, and swept
down on Rupert with gibbering grins.</p>

<p>The room, and the howling dead, and the
black portent before him circled dizzily around,
as with a last effort of departing consciousness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
he drew his pistol and fired full in the face of
Count Albert.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Perfect silence, perfect darkness; not a
breath, not a sound: the dead stillness of a
long-sealed tomb. Rupert lay on his back,
stunned, helpless, his pistol clenched in his
frozen hand, a smell of powder in the black
air. Where was he? Dead? In hell? He
reached his hand out cautiously; it fell on
dusty boards. Outside, far away, a clock
struck three. Had he dreamed? Of course;
but how ghastly a dream! With chattering
teeth he called softly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Otto!"</p>

<p>There was no reply, and none when he called
again and again. He staggered weakly to his
feet, groping for matches and candles. A panic
of abject terror came on him; the matches
were gone! He turned towards the fireplace:
a single coal glowed in the white ashes. He
swept a mass of papers and dusty books from
the table, and with trembling hands cowered
over the embers, until he succeeded in lighting
the dry tinder. Then he piled the old books
on the blaze, and looked fearfully around.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>No: It was gone,&mdash;thank God for that; the
hook was empty.</p>

<p>But why did Otto sleep so soundly; why did
he not awake?</p>

<p>He stepped unsteadily across the room in the
flaring light of the burning books, and knelt by
the mattress.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So they found him in the morning, when no
one came to the inn from Kropfsberg Keep,
and the quaking Peter Rosskopf arranged a
relief party;&mdash;found him kneeling beside the
mattress where Otto lay, shot in the throat
and quite dead.</p>

<h2>THE WHITE VILLA.</h2>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<h2><big>The White Villa.</big></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we left Naples on the 8.10 train for
P&aelig;stum, Tom and I, we fully intended returning
by the 2.46. Not because two hours time
seemed enough wherein to exhaust the interests
of those deathless ruins of a dead civilization,
but simply for the reason that, as our <i>Indicatore</i>
informed us, there was but one other train, and
that at 6.11, which would land us in Naples too
late for the dinner at the Turners and the San
Carlo afterwards. Not that I cared in the
least for the dinner or the theatre; but then, I
was not so obviously in Miss Turner's good
graces as Tom Rendel was, which made a
difference.</p>

<p>However, we had promised, so that was an
end of it.</p>

<p>This was in the spring of '88, and at that
time the railroad, which was being pushed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
onward to Reggio, whereby travellers to Sicily
might be spared the agonies of a night on the
fickle Mediterranean, reached no farther than
Agropoli, some twenty miles beyond P&aelig;stum;
but although the trains were as yet few and
slow, we accepted the half-finished road with
gratitude, for it penetrated the very centre of
Campanian brigandage, and made it possible for
us to see the matchless temples in safety, while
a few years before it was necessary for intending
visitors to obtain a military escort from the
Government; and military escorts are not for
young architects.</p>

<p>So we set off contentedly, that white May
morning, determined to make the best of our
few hours, little thinking that before we saw
Naples again we were to witness things that
perhaps no American had ever seen before.</p>

<p>For a moment, when we left the train at
"Pesto," and started to walk up the flowery
lane leading to the temples, we were almost
inclined to curse this same railroad. We had
thought, in our innocence, that we should be
alone, that no one else would think of enduring
the long four hours' ride from Naples just to spend
two hours in the ruins of these temples; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the event proved our unwisdom. We were <i>not</i>
alone. It was a compact little party of conventional
sight-seers that accompanied us. The inevitable
English family with the three daughters,
prominent of teeth, flowing of hair, aggressive of
scarlet Murrays and Baedekers; the two blond
and untidy Germans; a French couple from the
pages of <i>La Vie Parisienne</i>; and our "old man
of the sea," the white-bearded Presbyterian
minister from Pennsylvania who had made our
life miserable in Rome at the time of the Pope's
Jubilee. Fortunately for us, this terrible old man
had fastened himself upon a party of American
school-teachers travelling <i>en Cook</i>, and
for the time we were safe; but our vision of
two hours of dreamy solitude faded lamentably
away.</p>

<p>Yet how beautiful it was! this golden meadow
walled with far, violet mountains, breathless
under a May sun; and in the midst, rising from
tangles of asphodel and acanthus, vast in the
vacant plain, three temples, one silver gray, one
golden gray, and one flushed with intangible
rose. And all around nothing but velvet
meadows stretching from the dim mountains
behind, away to the sea, that showed only as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
thin line of silver just over the edge of the still
grass.</p>

<p>The tide of tourists swept noisily through
the Basilica and the temple of Poseidon across
the meadow to the distant temple of Ceres, and
Tom and I were left alone to drink in all the
fine wine of dreams that was possible in the
time left us. We gave but little space to
examining the temples the tourists had left, but
in a few moments found ourselves lying in the
grass to the east of Poseidon, looking dimly out
towards the sea, heard now, but not seen,&mdash;a
vague and pulsating murmur that blended with
the humming of bees all about us.</p>

<p>A small shepherd boy, with a woolly dog,
made shy advances of friendship, and in a little
time we had set him to gathering flowers for us:
asphodels and bee-orchids, anemones, and the
little thin green iris so fairylike and frail. The
murmur of the tourist crowd had merged itself
in the moan of the sea, and it was very still;
suddenly I heard the words I had been waiting
for,&mdash;the suggestion I had refrained from making
myself, for I knew Thomas.</p>

<p>"I say, old man, shall we let the 2.46 go to
thunder?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>I chuckled to myself. "But the Turners?"</p>

<p>"They be blowed, we can tell them we
missed the train."</p>

<p>"That is just exactly what we shall do," I
said, pulling out my watch, "unless we start for
the station right now."</p>

<p>But Tom drew an acanthus leaf across his
face and showed no signs of moving; so I filled
my pipe again, and we missed the train.</p>

<p>As the sun dropped lower towards the sea,
changing its silver line to gold, we pulled ourselves
together, and for an hour or more
sketched vigorously; but the mood was not on
us. It was "too jolly fine to waste time working,"
as Tom said; so we started off to explore
the single street of the squalid town of Pesto
that was lost within the walls of dead Poseidonia.
It was not a pretty village,&mdash;if you
can call a rut-riven lane and a dozen houses a
village,&mdash;nor were the inhabitants thereof reassuring
in appearance. There was no sign of
a church,&mdash;nothing but dirty huts, and in the
midst, one of two stories, rejoicing in the name
of <i>Albergo del Sole</i>, the first story of which was
a black and cavernous smithy, where certain
swarthy knaves, looking like banditti out of a
job, sat smoking sulkily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"We might stay here all night," said Tom,
grinning askance at this choice company; but
his suggestion was not received with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Down where the lane from the station joined
the main road stood the only sign of modern
civilization,&mdash;a great square structure, half
villa, half fortress, with round turrets on its
four corners, and a ten-foot wall surrounding it.
There were no windows in its first story, so far
as we could see, and it had evidently been at
one time the fortified villa of some Campanian
noble. Now, however, whether because brigandage
had been stamped out, or because the
villa was empty and deserted, it was no longer
formidable; the gates of the great wall hung
sagging on their hinges, brambles growing all
over them, and many of the windows in the
upper story were broken and black. It was a
strange place, weird and mysterious, and we
looked at it curiously. "There is a story about
that place," said Tom, with conviction.</p>

<p>It was growing late: the sun was near the
edge of the sea as we walked down the ivy-grown
walls of the vanished city for the last
time, and as we turned back, a red flush poured
from the west, and painted the Doric temples<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in pallid rose against the evanescent purple of
the Apennines. Already a thin mist was rising
from the meadows, and the temples hung pink
in the misty grayness.</p>

<p>It was a sorrow to leave the beautiful things,
but we could run no risk of missing this last
train, so we walked slowly back towards the
temples.</p>

<p>"What is that Johnny waving his arm at us
for?" asked Tom, suddenly.</p>

<p>"How should I know? We are not on his
land, and the walls don't matter."</p>

<p>We pulled out our watches simultaneously.</p>

<p>"What time are you?" I said.</p>

<p>"Six minutes before six."</p>

<p>"And I am seven minutes. It can't take us
all that time to walk to the station."</p>

<p>"Are you sure the train goes at 6.11?"</p>

<p>"Dead sure," I answered; and showed him
the <i>Indicatore</i>.</p>

<p>By this time a woman and two children were
shrieking at us hysterically; but what they said
I had no idea, their Italian being of a strange
and awful nature.</p>

<p>"Look here," I said, "let's run; perhaps our
watches are both slow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or&mdash;perhaps the time-table is changed."</p>

<p>Then we ran, and the populace cheered and
shouted with enthusiasm; our dignified run
became a panic-stricken rout, for as we turned
into the lane, smoke was rising from beyond
the bank that hid the railroad; a bell rang;
we were so near that we could hear the interrogative
<i>Pronte?</i> the impatient <i>Partenza!</i>
and the definitive <i>Andiamo!</i> But the train
was five hundred yards away, steaming towards
Naples, when we plunged into the station as the
clock struck six, and yelled for the station-master.</p>

<p>He came, and we indulged in crimination and
recrimination.</p>

<p>When we could regard the situation calmly, it
became apparent that the time-table <i>had</i> been
changed two days before, the 6.11 now leaving
at 5.58. A <i>facchino</i> came in, and we four
sat down and regarded the situation judicially.</p>

<p>"Was there any other train?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Could we stay at the Albergo del Sole?"</p>

<p>A forefinger drawn across the throat by the
Capo Stazione with a significant "cluck" closed
that question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we must stay with you here at the
station."</p>

<p>"But, Signori, I am not married. I live here
only with the <i>facchini</i>. I have only one room
to sleep in. It is impossible!"</p>

<p>"But we must sleep somewhere, likewise eat.
What can we do?" and we shifted the responsibility
deftly on the shoulders of the poor old
man, who was growing excited again.</p>

<p>He trotted nervously up and down the station
for a minute, then he called the <i>facchino</i>. "Giuseppe,
go up to the villa and ask if two <i>forestieri</i>
who have missed the last train can stay there all
night!"</p>

<p>Protests were useless. The <i>facchino</i> was
gone, and we waited anxiously for his return.
It seemed as though he would never come.
Darkness had fallen, and the moon was rising
over the mountains. At last he appeared.</p>

<p>"The Signori may stay all night, and welcome;
but they cannot come to dinner, for
there is nothing in the house to eat!"</p>

<p>This was not reassuring, and again the old
station-master lost himself in meditation. The
results were admirable, for in a little time the
table in the waiting-room had been transformed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
into a dining-table, and Tom and I
were ravenously devouring a big omelette, and
bread and cheese, and drinking a most shocking
sour wine as though it were Ch&acirc;teau Yquem.
A <i>facchino</i> served us, with clumsy good-will; and
when we had induced our nervous old host to
sit down with us and partake of his own hospitality,
we succeeded in forming a passably jolly
dinner-party, forgetting over our sour wine and
cigarettes the coming hours from ten until sunrise,
which lay before us in a dubious mist.</p>

<p>It was with crowding apprehensions which we
strove in vain to joke away that we set out at
last to retrace our steps to the mysterious villa,
the <i>facchino</i> Giuseppe leading the way. By
this time the moon was well overhead, and just
behind us as we tramped up the dewy lane,
white in the moonlight between the ink-black
hedgerows on either side. How still it was!
Not a breath of air, not a sound of life; only
the awful silence that had lain almost unbroken
for two thousand years over this vast graveyard
of a dead world.</p>

<p>As we passed between the shattered gates
and wound our way in the moonlight through
the maze of gnarled fruit-trees, decaying farm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
implements and piles of lumber, towards the
small door that formed the only opening in
the first story of this deserted fortress, the
cold silence was shattered by the harsh baying
of dogs somewhere in the distance to the
right, beyond the barns that formed one side
of the court. From the villa came neither
light nor sound. Giuseppe knocked at the
weather-worn door, and the sound echoed cavernously
within; but there was no other reply.
He knocked again and again, and at length
we heard the rasping jar of sliding bolts, and
the door opened a little, showing an old, old
man, bent with age and gaunt with malaria.
Over his head he held a big Roman lamp,
with three wicks, that cast strange shadows
on his face,&mdash;a face that was harmless in its
senility, but intolerably sad. He made no
reply to our timid salutations, but motioned
tremblingly to us to enter; and with a last
"good-night" to Giuseppe we obeyed, and
stood half-way up the stone stairs that led
directly from the door, while the old man
tediously shot every bolt and adjusted the
heavy bar.</p>

<p>Then we followed him in the semi-darkness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
up the steps into what had been the great
hall of the villa. A fire was burning in a
great fireplace so beautiful in design that
Tom and I looked at each other with interest.
By its fitful light we could see that we were
in a huge circular room covered by a flat,
saucer-shaped dome,&mdash;a room that must once
have been superb and splendid, but that now
was a lamentable wreck. The frescoes on the
dome were stained and mildewed, and here
and there the plaster was gone altogether; the
carved doorways that led out on all sides had lost
half the gold with which they had once been
covered, and the floor was of brick, sunken
into treacherous valleys. Rough chests, piles
of old newspapers, fragments of harnesses,
farm implements, a heap of rusty carbines and
cutlasses, nameless litter of every possible kind,
made the room into a wilderness which under
the firelight seemed even more picturesque than
it really was. And on this inexpressible confusion
of lumber the pale shapes of the seventeenth-century
nymphs, startling in their
weather-stained nudity, looked down with vacant
smiles.</p>

<p>For a few moments we warmed ourselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
before the fire; and then, in the same dejected
silence, the old man led the way to one of the
many doors, handed us a brass lamp, and with
a stiff bow turned his back on us.</p>

<p>Once in our room alone, Tom and I looked at
each other with faces that expressed the most
complex emotions.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the rum goes," said Tom, "this
is the rummiest go I ever experienced!"</p>

<p>"Right, my boy; as you very justly remark, we
are in for it. Help me shut this door, and then
we will reconnoitre, take account of stock, and
size up our chances."</p>

<p>But the door showed no sign of closing; it
grated on the brick floor and stuck in the
warped casing, and it took our united efforts
to jam the two inches of oak into its place, and
turn the enormous old key in its rusty lock.</p>

<p>"Better now, much better now," said Tom;
"now let us see where we are."</p>

<p>The room was easily twenty-five feet square,
and high in proportion; evidently it had been
a state apartment, for the walls were covered
with carved panelling that had once been white
and gold, with mirrors in the panels, the wood
now stained every imaginable color, the mirrors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
cracked and broken, and dull with mildew. A
big fire had just been lighted in the fireplace,
the shutters were closed, and although the only
furniture consisted of two massive bedsteads,
and a chair with one leg shorter than the others,
the room seemed almost comfortable.</p>

<p>I opened one of the shutters, that closed the
great windows that ran from the floor almost to
the ceiling, and nearly fell through the cracked
glass into the floorless balcony. "Tom, come
here, quick," I cried; and for a few minutes
neither of us thought about our dubious surroundings,
for we were looking at P&aelig;stum by
moonlight.</p>

<p>A flat, white mist, like water, lay over the entire
meadow; from the midst rose against the
blue-black sky the three ghostly temples, black
and silver in the vivid moonlight, floating, it
seemed, in the fog; and behind them, seen in
broken glints between the pallid shafts, stretched
the line of the silver sea.</p>

<p>Perfect silence,&mdash;the silence of implacable
death.</p>

<p>We watched the white tide of mist rise around
the temples, until we were chilled through, and
so presently went to bed. There was but one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
door in the room, and that was securely locked;
the great windows were twenty feet from the
ground, so we felt reasonably safe from all
possible attack.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Tom was asleep and breathing
audibly; but my constitution is more nervous
than his, and I lay awake for some
little time, thinking of our curious adventure
and of its possible outcome. Finally, I fell
asleep,&mdash;for how long I do not know: but I
woke with the feeling that some one had tried
the handle of the door. The fire had fallen into
a heap of coals which cast a red glow in the
room, whereby I could see dimly the outline of
Tom's bed, the broken-legged chair in front of
the fireplace, and the door in its deep casing by
the chimney, directly in front of my bed. I sat
up, nervous from my sudden awakening under
these strange circumstances, and stared at the
door. The latch rattled, and the door swung
smoothly open. I began to shiver coldly. That
door was locked; Tom and I had all we could
do to jam it together and lock it. But we <i>did</i>
lock it; and now it was opening silently. In
a minute more it as silently closed.</p>

<p>Then I heard a footstep,&mdash;I swear I heard a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
footstep <i>in the room</i>, and with it the <i>frou-frou</i>
of trailing skirts; my breath stopped and my
teeth grated against each other as I heard the
soft footfalls and the feminine rustle pass along
the room towards the fireplace. My eyes saw
nothing; yet there was enough light in the room
for me to distinguish the pattern on the carved
panels of the door. The steps stopped by the
fire, and I saw the broken-legged chair lean to
the left, with a little jar as its short leg touched
the floor.</p>

<p>I sat still, frozen, motionless, staring at the
vacancy that was filled with such terror for me;
and as I looked, the seat of the chair creaked,
and it came back to its upright position again.</p>

<p>And then the footsteps came down the room
lightly, towards the window; there was a pause,
and then the great shutters swung back, and
the white moonlight poured in. Its brilliancy
was unbroken by any shadow, by any sign of
material substance.</p>

<p>I tried to cry out, to make some sound, to
awaken Tom; this sense of utter loneliness in
the presence of the Inexplicable was maddening.
I don't know whether my lips obeyed my will
or no; at all events, Tom lay motionless, with
his deaf ear up, and gave no sign.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The shutters closed as silently as they had
opened; the moonlight was gone, the firelight
also, and in utter darkness I waited. If I could
only <i>see</i>! If something were visible, I should
not mind it so much; but this ghastly hearing of
every little sound, every rustle of a gown, every
breath, yet seeing nothing, was soul-destroying.
I think in my abject terror I prayed that I might
see, only see; but the darkness was unbroken.</p>

<p>Then the footsteps began to waver fitfully,
and I heard the rustle of garments sliding to
the floor, the clatter of little shoes flung down,
the rattle of buttons, and of metal against wood.</p>

<p>Rigors shot over me, and my whole body
shivered with collapse as I sank back on the
pillow, waiting with every nerve tense, listening
with all my life.</p>

<p>The coverlid was turned back beside me, and
in another moment the great bed sank a little as
something slipped between the sheets with an
audible sigh.</p>

<p>I called to my aid every atom of remaining
strength, and, with a cry that shivered between
my clattering teeth, I hurled myself headlong
from the bed on to the floor.</p>

<p>I must have lain for some time stunned and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
unconscious, for when I finally came to myself
it was cold in the room, there was no last glow
of lingering coals in the fireplace, and I was stiff
with chill.</p>

<p>It all flashed over me like the haunting of a
heavy dream. I laughed a little at the dim
memory, with the thought, "I must try to recollect
all the details; they will do to tell Tom,"
and rose stiffly to return to bed, when&mdash;there
it was again, and my heart stopped,&mdash;the hand
on the door.</p>

<p>I paused and listened. The door opened
with a muffled creak, closed again, and I heard
the lock turn rustily. I would have died now
before getting into that bed again; but there
was terror equally without; so I stood trembling
and listened,&mdash;listened to heavy, stealthy
steps creeping along on the other side of the
bed. I clutched the coverlid, staring across
into the dark.</p>

<p>There was a rush in the air by my face, the
sound of a blow, and simultaneously a shriek, so
awful, so despairing, so blood-curdling that I
felt my senses leaving me again as I sank
crouching on the floor by the bed.</p>

<p>And then began the awful duel, the duel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of invisible, audible shapes; of things that
shrieked and raved, mingling thin, feminine
cries with low, stifled curses and indistinguishable
words. Round and round the room, footsteps
chasing footsteps in the ghastly night,
now away by Tom's bed, now rushing swiftly
down the great room until I felt the flash of
swirling drapery on my hard lips. Round
and round, turning and twisting till my brain
whirled with the mad cries.</p>

<p>They were coming nearer. I felt the jar of
their feet on the floor beside me. Came one
long, gurgling moan close over my head, and
then, crushing down upon me, the weight of a
collapsing body; there was long hair over my
face, and in my staring eyes; and as awful silence
succeeded the less awful tumult, life went out,
and I fell unfathomable miles into nothingness.</p>

<p>The gray dawn was sifting through the chinks
in the shutters when I opened my eyes again.
I lay stunned and faint, staring up at the mouldy
frescoes on the ceiling, struggling to gather
together my wandering senses and knit them
into something like consciousness. But now
as I pulled myself little by little together there
was no thought of dreams before me. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
after another the awful incidents of that unspeakable
night came back, and I lay incapable
of movement, of action, trying to piece together
the whirling fragments of memory that
circled dizzily around me.</p>

<p>Little by little it grew lighter in the room. I
could see the pallid lines struggling through
the shutters behind me, grow stronger along
the broken and dusty floor. The tarnished
mirrors reflected dirtily the growing daylight;
a door closed, far away, and I heard the crowing
of a cock; then by and by the whistle of a
passing train.</p>

<p>Years seemed to have passed since I first came
into this terrible room. I had lost the use of
my tongue, my voice refused to obey my panic-stricken
desire to cry out; once or twice I tried
in vain to force an articulate sound through my
rigid lips; and when at last a broken whisper
rewarded my feverish struggles, I felt a strange
sense of great victory. How soundly he slept!
Ordinarily, rousing him was no easy task, and
now he revolted steadily against being awakened
at this untimely hour. It seemed to me that I
had called him for ages almost, before I heard
him grunt sleepily and turn in bed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tom," I cried weakly, "Tom, come and
help me!"</p>

<p>"What do you want? what is the matter with
you?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask, come and help me!"</p>

<p>"Fallen out of bed I guess;" and he laughed
drowsily.</p>

<p>My abject terror lest he should go to sleep
again gave me new strength. Was it the actual
physical paralysis born of killing fear that held
me down? I could not have raised my head
from the floor on my life; I could only cry out
in deadly fear for Tom to come and help me.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get up and get into bed?"
he answered, when I implored him to come to
me. "You have got a bad nightmare; wake
up!"</p>

<p>But something in my voice roused him at last,
and he came chuckling across the room, stopping
to throw open two of the great shutters and
let a burst of white light into the room. He
climbed up on the bed and peered over jeeringly.
With the first glance the laugh died, and he
leaped the bed and bent over me.</p>

<p>"My God, man, what is the matter with you?
You are hurt!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know what is the matter; lift me
up, get me away from here, and I'll tell you all
I know."</p>

<p>"But, old chap, you must be hurt awfully;
the floor is covered with blood!"</p>

<p>He lifted my head and held me in his powerful
arms. I looked down: a great red stain
blotted the floor beside me.</p>

<p>But, apart from the black bruise on my head,
there was no sign of a wound on my body, nor
stain of blood on my lips. In as few words as
possible I told him the whole story.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of this," he said when I had
finished; "this is no place for us. Brigands I
can stand, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>He helped me to dress, and as soon as possible
we forced open the heavy door, the door I
had seen turn so softly on its hinges only a few
hours before, and came out into the great circular
hall, no less strange and mysterious now
in the half light of dawn than it had been by
firelight. The room was empty, for it must
have been very early, although a fire already
blazed in the fireplace. We sat by the fire
some time, seeing no one. Presently slow footsteps
sounded in the stairway, and the old man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
entered, silent as the night before, nodding to
us civilly, but showing by no sign any surprise
which he may have felt at our early rising. In
absolute silence he moved around, preparing
coffee for us; and when at last the frugal breakfast
was ready, and we sat around the rough
table munching coarse bread and sipping the
black coffee, he would reply to our overtures
only by monosyllables.</p>

<p>Any attempt at drawing from him some facts
as to the history of the villa was received with
a grave and frigid repellence that baffled us; and
we were forced to say <i>addio</i> with our hunger for
some explanation of the events of the night still
unsatisfied.</p>

<p>But we saw the temples by sunrise, when the
mistlike lambent opals bathed the bases of the
tall columns salmon in the morning light! It
was a rhapsody in the pale and unearthly colors
of Puvis de Chavannes vitalized and made glorious
with splendid sunlight; the apotheosis of
mist; a vision never before seen, never to be forgotten.
It was so beautiful that the memory of
my ghastly night paled and faded, and it was Tom
who assailed the station-master with questions
while we waited for the train from Agropoli.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Luckily he was more than loquacious, he was
voluble under the ameliorating influence of the
money we forced upon him; and this, in few
words, was the story he told us while we sat on
the platform smoking, marvelling at the mists
that rose to the east, now veiling, now revealing
the lavender Apennines.</p>

<p>"Is there a story of <i>La Villa Bianca</i>?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Signori, certainly; and a story very
strange and very terrible. It was much time
ago, a hundred,&mdash;two hundred years; I do
not know. Well, the Duca di San Damiano
married a lady so fair, so most beautiful that
she was called <i>La Luna di Pesto</i>; but she was
of the people,&mdash;more, she was of the banditti:
her father was of Calabria, and a terror of the
Campagna. But the Duke was young, and he
married her, and for her built the white villa;
and it was a wonder throughout Campania,&mdash;you
have seen? It is splendid now, even if a ruin.
Well, it was less than a year after they came to
the villa before the Duke grew jealous,&mdash;jealous
of the new captain of the banditti who took the
place of the father of <i>La Luna</i>, himself killed in
a great battle up there in the mountains. Was
there cause? Who shall know? But there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
stories among the people of terrible things in the
villa, and how <i>La Luna</i> was seen almost never
outside the walls. Then the Duke would go for
many days to Napoli, coming home only now and
then to the villa that was become a fortress,
so many men guarded its never-opening gates.
And once&mdash;it was in the spring&mdash;the Duke came
silently down from Napoli, and there, by the
three poplars you see away towards the north,
his carriage was set upon by armed men, and
he was almost killed; but he had with him
many guards, and after a terrible fight the brigands
were beaten off; but before him, wounded,
lay the captain,&mdash;the man whom he feared and
hated. He looked at him, lying there under the
torchlight, and in his hand saw <i>his own sword</i>.
Then he became a devil: with the same sword
he ran the brigand through, leaped in the carriage,
and, entering the villa, crept to the chamber
of <i>La Luna</i>, and killed her with the sword
she had given to her lover.</p>

<p>"This is all the story of the White Villa,
except that the Duke came never again to
Pesto. He went back to the king at Napoli,
and for many years he was the scourge of
the banditti of Campania; for the King made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
him a general, and San Damiano was a name
feared by the lawless and loved by the peaceful,
until he was killed in a battle down by
Mormanno.</p>

<p>"And <i>La Luna</i>? Some say she comes back
to the villa, once a year, when the moon is full,
in the month when she was slain; for the Duke
buried her, they say, with his own hands, in the
garden that was once under the window of her
chamber; and as she died unshriven, so was she
buried without the pale of the Church. Therefore
she cannot sleep in peace,&mdash;<i>non &egrave; vero</i>? I
do not know if the story is true, but this is the
story, Signori, and there is the train for Napoli.
<i>Ah, grazie! Signori, grazie tanto! A rivederci!
Signori, a rivederci!</i>"</p>

<h2>SISTER MADDELENA.</h2>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<h2><big>Sister Maddelena.</big></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Across</span> the valley of the Oreto from Monreale,
on the slopes of the mountains just
above the little village of Parco, lies the old
convent of Sta. Catarina. From the cloister
terrace at Monreale you can see its pale walls
and the slim campanile of its chapel rising from
the crowded citron and mulberry orchards that
flourish, rank and wild, no longer cared for by
pious and loving hands. From the rough road
that climbs the mountains to Assunto, the convent
is invisible, a gnarled and ragged olive
grove intervening, and a spur of cliffs as well,
while from Palermo one sees only the speck of
white, flashing in the sun, indistinguishable from
the many similar gleams of desert monastery or
pauper village.</p>

<p>Partly because of this seclusion, partly by
reason of its extreme beauty, partly, it may be,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
because the present owners are more than
charming and gracious in their pressing hospitality,
Sta. Catarina seems to preserve an
element of the poetic, almost magical; and as
I drove with the Cavaliere Valguanera one
evening in March out of Palermo, along the
garden valley of the Oreto, then up the mountain
side where the warm light of the spring
sunset swept across from Monreale, lying
golden and mellow on the luxuriant growth of
figs, and olives, and orange-trees, and fantastic
cacti, and so up to where the path of the convent
swung off to the right round a dizzy point
of cliff that reached out gaunt and gray from the
olives below,&mdash;as I drove thus in the balmy air,
and saw of a sudden a vision of creamy walls and
orange roofs, draped in fantastic festoons of
roses, with a single curving palm-tree stuck
black and feathery against the gold sunset, it
is hardly to be wondered at that I should slip
into a mood of visionary enjoyment, looking
for a time on the whole thing as the misty
phantasm of a summer dream.</p>

<p>The Cavaliere had introduced himself to
us,&mdash;Tom Rendel and me,&mdash;one morning
soon after we reached Palermo, when, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
first bewilderment of architects in this paradise
of art and color, we were working nobly at
our sketches in that dream of delight, the Capella
Palatina. He was himself an amateur arch&aelig;ologist,
he told us, and passionately devoted to his
island; so he felt impelled to speak to any one
whom he saw appreciating the almost&mdash;and
in a way fortunately&mdash;unknown beauties of
Palermo. In a little time we were fully acquainted,
and talking like the oldest friends.
Of course he knew acquaintances of Rendel's,&mdash;some
one always does: this time they were
officers on the tubby U. S. S. "Quinebaug," that,
during the summer of 1888, was trying to uphold
the maritime honor of the United States
in European waters. Luckily for us, one of
the officers was a kind of cousin of Rendel's,
and came from Baltimore as well, so, as he had
visited at the Cavaliere's place, we were soon
invited to do the same. It was in this way
that, with the luck that attends Rendel wherever
he goes, we came to see something of
domestic life in Italy, and that I found myself
involved in another of those adventures for
which I naturally sought so little.</p>

<p>I wonder if there is any other place in Sicily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
so faultless as Sta. Catarina? Taormina is a
paradise, an epitome of all that is beautiful in
Italy,&mdash;Venice excepted. Girgenti is a solemn
epic, with its golden temples between the sea and
hills. Cefal&ugrave; is wild and strange, and Monreale
a vision out of a fairy tale; but Sta. Catarina!&mdash;</p>

<p>Fancy a convent of creamy stone and rose-red
brick perched on a ledge of rock midway
between earth and heaven, the cliff falling
almost sheer to the valley two hundred feet
and more, the mountain rising behind straight
towards the sky; all the rocks covered with cactus
and dwarf fig-trees, the convent draped in
smothering roses, and in front a terrace with a
fountain in the midst; and then&mdash;nothing&mdash;between
you and the sapphire sea, six miles
away. Below stretches the Eden valley, the
Concha d'Oro, gold-green fig orchards alternating
with smoke-blue olives, the mountains rising
on either hand and sinking undulously away
towards the bay where, like a magic city of ivory
and nacre, Palermo lies guarded by the twin
mountains, Monte Pellegrino and Capo Zafferano,
arid rocks like dull amethysts, rose in
sunlight, violet in shadow: lions couchant, guarding
the sleeping town.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Seen as we saw it for the first time that hot
evening in March, with the golden lambent light
pouring down through the valley, making it in
verity a "shell of gold," sitting in Indian chairs
on the terrace, with the perfume of roses and
jasmines all around us, the valley of the Oreto,
Palermo, Sta. Catarina, Monreale,&mdash;all were but
parts of a dreamy vision, like the heavenly city
of Sir Percivale, to attain which he passed
across the golden bridge that burned after him
as he vanished in the intolerable light of the
Beatific Vision.</p>

<p>It was all so unreal, so phantasmal, that I
was not surprised in the least when, late in
the evening after the ladies had gone to their
rooms, and the Cavaliere, Tom, and I were
stretched out in chairs on the terrace, smoking
lazily under the multitudinous stars, the Cavaliere
said, "There is something I really must tell
you both before you go to bed, so that you may
be spared any unnecessary alarm."</p>

<p>"You are going to say that the place is
haunted," said Rendel, feeling vaguely on the
floor beside him for his glass of Amaro: "thank
you; it is all it needs."</p>

<p>The Cavaliere smiled a little: "Yes, that is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
just it. Sta. Catarina is really haunted; and
much as my reason revolts against the idea as
superstitious and savoring of priestcraft, yet I
must acknowledge I see no way of avoiding the
admission. I do not presume to offer any explanations,
I only state the fact; and the fact is that
to-night one or other of you will, in all human&mdash;or
unhuman&mdash;probability, receive a visit from
Sister Maddelena. You need not be in the
least afraid, the apparition is perfectly gentle
and harmless; and, moreover, having seen it
once, you will never see it again. No one
sees the ghost, or whatever it is, but once,
and that usually the first night he spends in
the house. I myself saw the thing eight&mdash;nine
years ago, when I first bought the place
from the Marchese di Muxaro; all my people
have seen it, nearly all my guests, so I think you
may as well be prepared."</p>

<p>"Then tell us what to expect," I said; "what
kind of a ghost is this nocturnal visitor?"</p>

<p>"It is simple enough. Some time to-night you
will suddenly awake and see before you a Carmelite
nun who will look fixedly at you, say distinctly
and very sadly, 'I cannot sleep,' and
then vanish. That is all, it is hardly worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
speaking of, only some people are terribly
frightened if they are visited unwarned by
strange apparitions; so I tell you this that you
may be prepared."</p>

<p>"This was a Carmelite convent, then?" I
said.</p>

<p>"Yes; it was suppressed after the unification
of Italy, and given to the House of Muxaro; but
the family died out, and I bought it. There is
a story about the ghostly nun, who was only a
novice, and even that unwillingly, which gives
an interest to an otherwise very commonplace
and uninteresting ghost."</p>

<p>"I beg that you will tell it us," cried Rendel.</p>

<p>"There is a storm coming," I added. "See,
the lightning is flashing already up among the
mountains at the head of the valley; if the story
is tragic, as it must be, now is just the time for
it. You will tell it, will you not?"</p>

<p>The Cavaliere smiled that slow, cryptic smile
of his that was so unfathomable.</p>

<p>"As you say, there is a shower coming, and
as we have fierce tempests here, we might not
sleep; so perhaps we may as well sit up a little
longer, and I will tell you the story."</p>

<p>The air was utterly still, hot and oppressive;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the rich, sick odor of the oranges just bursting
into bloom came up from the valley in a gently
rising tide. The sky, thick with stars, seemed
mirrored in the rich foliage below, so numerous
were the glow-worms under the still trees, and
the fireflies that gleamed in the hot air. Lightning
flashed fitfully from the darkening west; but
as yet no thunder broke the heavy silence.</p>

<p>The Cavaliere lighted another cigar, and
pulled a cushion under his head so that he
could look down to the distant lights of the
city. "This is the story," he said.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time, late in the last century,
the Duca di Castiglione was attached to
the court of Charles III., King of the Two
Sicilies, down at Palermo. They tell me he
was very ambitious, and, not content with
marrying his son to one of the ladies of the
House of Tuscany, had betrothed his only
daughter, Rosalia, to Prince Antonio, a cousin
of the king. His whole life was wrapped up
in the fame of his family, and he quite forgot
all domestic affection in his madness for dynastic
glory. His son was a worthy scion, cold
and proud; but Rosalia was, according to legend,
utterly the reverse,&mdash;a passionate, beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
girl, wilful and headstrong, and careless of her
family and the world.</p>

<p>"The time had nearly come for her to marry
Prince Antonio, a typical <i>rou&eacute;</i> of the Spanish
court, when, through the treachery of a servant,
the Duke discovered that his daughter was in
love with a young military officer whose name
I don't remember, and that an elopement had
been planned to take place the next night.
The fury and dismay of the old autocrat passed
belief; he saw in a flash the downfall of all his
hopes of family aggrandizement through union
with the royal house, and, knowing well the
spirit of his daughter, despaired of ever
bringing her to subjection. Nevertheless, he
attacked her unmercifully, and, by bullying and
threats, by imprisonment, and even bodily
chastisement, he tried to break her spirit and
bend her to his indomitable will. Through his
power at court he had the lover sent away to
the mainland, and for more than a year he held
his daughter closely imprisoned in his palace
on the Toledo,&mdash;that one, you may remember,
on the right, just beyond the Via del Collegio
dei Gesuiti, with the beautiful iron-work grilles
at all the windows, and the painted frieze.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
But nothing could move her, nothing bend
her stubborn will; and at last, furious at the
girl he could not govern, Castiglione sent her to
this convent, then one of the few houses of
barefoot Carmelite nuns in Italy. He stipulated
that she should take the name of Maddelena,
that he should never hear of her again,
and that she should be held an absolute prisoner
in this conventual castle.</p>

<p>"Rosalia&mdash;or Sister Maddelena, as she was
now&mdash;believed her lover dead, for her father had
given her good proofs of this, and she believed
him; nevertheless she refused to marry another,
and seized upon the convent life as a blessed
relief from the tyranny of her maniacal father.</p>

<p>"She lived here for four or five years; her
name was forgotten at court and in her father's
palace. Rosalia di Castiglione was dead, and
only Sister Maddelena lived, a Carmelite nun,
in her place.</p>

<p>"In 1798 Ferdinand IV. found himself driven
from his throne on the mainland, his kingdom
divided, and he himself forced to flee to Sicily.
With him came the lover of the dead Rosalia,
now high in military honor. He on his part
had thought Rosalia dead, and it was only by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
accident that he found that she still lived, a
Carmelite nun. Then began the second act of
the romance that until then had been only sadly
commonplace, but now became dark and tragic.
Michele&mdash;Michele Biscari,&mdash;that was his
name; I remember now&mdash;haunted the region
of the convent, striving to communicate with
Sister Maddelena; and at last, from the cliffs
over us, up there among the citrons&mdash;you will
see by the next flash of lightning&mdash;he saw her
in the great cloister, recognized her in her white
habit, found her the same dark and splendid
beauty of six years before, only made more
beautiful by her white habit and her rigid life.
By and by he found a day when she was alone,
and tossed a ring to her as she stood in the
midst of the cloister. She looked up, saw him,
and from that moment lived only to love him
in life as she had loved his memory in the death
she had thought had overtaken him.</p>

<p>"With the utmost craft they arranged their
plans together. They could not speak, for a
word would have aroused the other inmates of
the convent. They could make signs only
when Sister Maddelena was alone. Michele
could throw notes to her from the cliff,&mdash;a feat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
demanding a strong arm, as you will see, if you
measure the distance with your eye,&mdash;and she
could drop replies from the window over the
cliff, which he picked up at the bottom.
Finally he succeeded in casting into the cloister
a coil of light rope. The girl fastened it to the
bars of one of the windows, and&mdash;so great is
the madness of love&mdash;Biscari actually climbed
the rope from the valley to the window of the
cell, a distance of almost two hundred feet, with
but three little craggy resting-places in all that
height. For nearly a month these nocturnal
visits were undiscovered, and Michele had
almost completed his arrangements for carrying
the girl from Sta. Catarina and away to Spain,
when unfortunately one of the sisters, suspecting
some mystery, from the changed face of Sister
Maddelena, began investigating, and at length
discovered the rope neatly coiled up by the
nun's window, and hidden under some clinging
vines. She instantly told the Mother Superior;
and together they watched from a window in
the crypt of the chapel,&mdash;the only place, as you
will see to-morrow, from which one could see the
window of Sister Maddelena's cell. They saw
the figure of Michele daringly ascending the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
slim rope; watched hour after hour, the Sister
remaining while the Superior went to say the
hours in the chapel, at each of which Sister
Maddelena was present; and at last, at prime,
just as the sun was rising, they saw the figure slip
down the rope, watched the rope drawn up and
concealed, and knew that Sister Maddelena was
in their hands for vengeance and punishment,&mdash;a
criminal.</p>

<p>"The next day, by the order of the Mother
Superior, Sister Maddelena was imprisoned in
one of the cells under the chapel, charged with
her guilt, and commanded to make full and
complete confession. But not a word would
she say, although they offered her forgiveness
if she would tell the name of her lover. At
last the Superior told her that after this fashion
would they act the coming night: she herself
would be placed in the crypt, tied in front of
the window, her mouth gagged; that the rope
would be lowered, and the lover allowed to
approach even to the sill of her window, and at
that moment the rope would be cut, and before
her eyes her lover would be dashed to death on
the ragged cliffs. The plan was feasible, and
Sister Maddelena knew that the Mother was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
perfectly capable of carrying it out. Her stubborn
spirit was broken, and in the only way possible;
she begged for mercy, for the sparing of
her lover. The Mother Superior was deaf at
first; at last she said, 'It is your life or his.
I will spare him on condition that you sacrifice
your own life.' Sister Maddelena accepted
the terms joyfully, wrote a last farewell to
Michele, fastened the note to the rope, and
with her own hands cut the rope and saw it
fall coiling down to the valley bed far below.</p>

<p>"Then she silently prepared for death; and at
midnight, while her lover was wandering, mad
with the horror of impotent fear, around the
white walls of the convent, Sister Maddelena,
for love of Michele, gave up her life. How, was
never known. That she was indeed dead was
only a suspicion, for when Biscari finally compelled
the civil authorities to enter the convent,
claiming that murder had been done there, they
found no sign. Sister Maddelena had been
sent to the parent house of the barefoot Carmelites
at Avila in Spain, so the Superior
stated, because of her incorrigible contumacy.
The old Duke of Castiglione refused to stir
hand or foot in the matter, and Michele, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
fruitless attempts to prove that the Superior of
Sta. Catarina had caused the death, was forced
to leave Sicily. He sought in Spain for very
long; but no sign of the girl was to be found,
and at last he died, exhausted with suffering
and sorrow.</p>

<p>"Even the name of Sister Maddelena was forgotten,
and it was not until the convents were
suppressed, and this house came into the hands
of the Muxaros, that her story was remembered.
It was then that the ghost began to appear; and,
an explanation being necessary, the story, or
legend, was obtained from one of the nuns who
still lived after the suppression. I think the
fact&mdash;for it is a fact&mdash;of the ghost rather
goes to prove that Michele was right, and that
poor Rosalia gave her life a sacrifice for love,&mdash;whether
in accordance with the terms of the
legend or not, I cannot say. One or the other of
you will probably see her to-night. You might
ask her for the facts. Well, that is all the
story of Sister Maddelena, known in the world
as Rosalia di Castiglione. Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"It is admirable," said Rendel, enthusiastically.
"But I fancy I should rather look on it
simply as a story, and not as a warning of what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
is going to happen. I don't much fancy real
ghosts myself."</p>

<p>"But the poor Sister is quite harmless;" and
Valguanera rose, stretching himself. "My servants
say she wants a mass said over her, or
something of that kind; but I haven't much love
for such priestly hocus-pocus,&mdash;I beg your pardon"
(turning to me), "I had forgotten that you
were a Catholic: forgive my rudeness."</p>

<p>"My dear Cavaliere, I beg you not to
apologize. I am sorry you cannot see things
as I do; but don't for a moment think I am
hypersensitive."</p>

<p>"I have an excuse,&mdash;perhaps you will say only
an explanation; but I live where I see all the absurdities
and corruptions of the Church."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you let the accidents blind you to the
essentials; but do not let us quarrel to-night,&mdash;see,
the storm is close on us. Shall we go in?"</p>

<p>The stars were blotted out through nearly all
the sky; low, thunderous clouds, massed at the
head of the valley, were sweeping over so close
that they seemed to brush the black pines on
the mountain above us. To the south and east
the storm-clouds had shut down almost to the sea,
leaving a space of black sky where the moon in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
its last quarter was rising just to the left of Monte
Pellegrino,&mdash;a black silhouette against the pallid
moonlight. The rosy lightning flashed almost
incessantly, and through the fitful darkness came
the sound of bells across the valley, the rushing
torrent below, and the dull roar of the approaching
rain, with a deep organ point of solemn thunder
through it all.</p>

<p>We fled indoors from the coming tempest,
and taking our candles, said "good-night," and
sought each his respective room.</p>

<p>My own was in the southern part of the old
convent, giving on the terrace we had just
quitted, and about over the main doorway.
The rushing storm, as it swept down the
valley with the swelling torrent beneath, was
very fascinating, and after wrapping myself
in a dressing-gown I stood for some time by
the deeply embrasured window, watching the
blazing lightning and the beating rain whirled
by fitful gusts of wind around the spurs of the
mountains. Gradually the violence of the
shower seemed to decrease, and I threw myself
down on my bed in the hot air, wondering
if I really was to experience the ghostly visit the
Cavaliere so confidently predicted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>I had thought out the whole matter to my own
satisfaction, and fancied I knew exactly what
I should do, in case Sister Maddelena came
to visit me. The story touched me: the thought
of the poor faithful girl who sacrificed herself for
her lover,&mdash;himself, very likely, quite unworthy,&mdash;and
who now could never sleep for reason of
her unquiet soul, sent out into the storm of eternity
without spiritual aid or counsel. I could not
sleep; for the still vivid lightning, the crowding
thoughts of the dead nun, and the shivering
anticipation of my possible visitation, made
slumber quite out of the question. No suspicion
of sleepiness had visited me, when, perhaps
an hour after midnight, came a sudden
vivid flash of lightning, and, as my dazzled
eyes began to regain the power of sight, I
saw her as plainly as in life,&mdash;a tall figure,
shrouded in the white habit of the Carmelites,
her head bent, her hands clasped before
her. In another flash of lightning she slowly
raised her head and looked at me long and
earnestly. She was very beautiful, like the
Virgin of Beltraffio in the National Gallery,&mdash;more
beautiful than I had supposed possible,
her deep, passionate eyes very tender and pitiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in their pleading, beseeching glance. I
hardly think I was frightened, or even startled,
but lay looking steadily at her as she stood
in the beating lightning.</p>

<p>Then she breathed, rather than articulated,
with a voice that almost brought tears, so
infinitely sad and sorrowful was it, "I cannot
sleep!" and the liquid eyes grew more pitiful
and questioning as bright tears fell from them
down the pale dark face.</p>

<p>The figure began to move slowly towards the
door, its eyes fixed on mine with a look that was
weary and almost agonized. I leaped from the
bed and stood waiting. A look of utter gratitude
swept over the face, and, turning, the figure
passed through the doorway.</p>

<p>Out into the shadow of the corridor it moved,
like a drift of pallid storm-cloud, and I followed,
all natural and instinctive fear or nervousness
quite blotted out by the part I felt I was to
play in giving rest to a tortured soul. The corridors
were velvet black; but the pale figure
floated before me always, an unerring guide,
now but a thin mist on the utter night, now
white and clear in the bluish lightning through
some window or doorway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Down the stairway into the lower hall, across
the refectory, where the great frescoed Crucifixion
flared into sudden clearness under the fitful
lightning, out into the silent cloister.</p>

<p>It was very dark. I stumbled along the heaving
bricks, now guiding myself by a hand on the
whitewashed wall, now by a touch on a column
wet with the storm. From all the eaves the rain
was dripping on to the pebbles at the foot of the
arcade: a pigeon, startled from the capital where
it was sleeping, beat its way into the cloister close.
Still the white thing drifted before me to the farther
side of the court, then along the cloister at
right angles, and paused before one of the many
doorways that led to the cells.</p>

<p>A sudden blaze of fierce lightning, the last
now of the fleeting trail of storm, leaped around
us, and in the vivid light I saw the white face
turned again with the look of overwhelming
desire, of beseeching pathos, that had choked
my throat with an involuntary sob when first
I saw Sister Maddelena. In the brief interval
that ensued after the flash, and before the roaring
thunder burst like the crash of battle over
the trembling convent, I heard again the sorrowful
words, "I cannot sleep," come from the impenetrable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
darkness. And when the lightning
came again, the white figure was gone.</p>

<p>I wandered around the courtyard, searching
in vain for Sister Maddelena, even until the
moonlight broke through the torn and sweeping
fringes of the storm. I tried the door where
the white figure vanished: it was locked; but I
had found what I sought, and, carefully noting
its location, went back to my room, but not to
sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning the Cavaliere asked Rendel
and me which of us had seen the ghost, and I
told him my story; then I asked him to grant
me permission to sift the thing to the bottom;
and he courteously gave the whole matter into
my charge, promising that he would consent to
anything.</p>

<p>I could hardly wait to finish breakfast; but no
sooner was this done than, forgetting my morning
pipe, I started with Rendel and the Cavaliere
to investigate.</p>

<p>"I am sure there is nothing in that cell," said
Valguanera, when we came in front of the door
I had marked. "It is curious that you should
have chosen the door of the very cell that
tradition assigns to Sister Maddelena; but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
have often examined that room myself, and I
am sure that there is no chance for anything to
be concealed. In fact, I had the floor taken up
once, soon after I came here, knowing the room
was that of the mysterious Sister, and thinking
that there, if anywhere, the monastic crime
would have taken place; still, we will go in, if
you like."</p>

<p>He unlocked the door, and we entered, one
of us, at all events, with a beating heart. The
cell was very small, hardly eight feet square.
There certainly seemed no opportunity for concealing
a body in the tiny place; and although I
sounded the floor and walls, all gave a solid,
heavy answer,&mdash;the unmistakable sound of
masonry.</p>

<p>For the innocence of the floor the Cavaliere
answered. He had, he said, had it all removed,
even to the curving surfaces of the vault below;
yet somewhere in this room the body of the
murdered girl was concealed,&mdash;of this I was certain.
But where? There seemed no answer;
and I was compelled to give up the search for
the moment, somewhat to the amusement of
Valguanera, who had watched curiously to see
if I could solve the mystery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>But I could not forget the subject, and towards
noon started on another tour of investigation.
I procured the keys from the Cavaliere,
and examined the cells adjoining; they
were apparently the same, each with its window
opposite the door, and nothing&mdash; Stay, were
they the same? I hastened into the suspected
cell; it was as I thought: this cell, being on the
corner, could have had two windows, yet only
one was visible, and that to the left, at right
angles with the doorway. Was it imagination?
As I sounded the wall opposite the door, where
the other window should be, I fancied that the
sound was a trifle less solid and dull. I was
becoming excited. I dashed back to the cell on
the right, and, forcing open the little window,
thrust my head out.</p>

<p>It was found at last! In the smooth surface
of the yellow wall was a rough space, following
approximately the shape of the other cell windows,
not plastered like the rest of the wall, but
showing the shapes of bricks through its thick
coatings of whitewash. I turned with a gasp
of excitement and satisfaction: yes, the embrasure
of the wall was deep enough; what a wall
it was!&mdash;four feet at least, and the opening of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the window reached to the floor, though the
window itself was hardly three feet square. I
felt absolutely certain that the secret was solved,
and called the Cavaliere and Rendel, too
excited to give them an explanation of my
theories.</p>

<p>They must have thought me mad when I
suddenly began scraping away at the solid wall
in front of the door; but in a few minutes they
understood what I was about, for under the
coatings of paint and plaster appeared the
original bricks; and as my architectural knowledge
had led me rightly, the space I had
cleared was directly over a vertical joint between
firm, workmanlike masonry on one hand,
and rough amateurish work on the other, bricks
laid anyway, and without order or science.</p>

<p>Rendel seized a pick, and was about to assail
the rude wall, when I stopped him.</p>

<p>"Let us be careful," I said; "who knows
what we may find?" So we set to work digging
out the mortar around a brick at about the
level of our eyes.</p>

<p>How hard the mortar had become! But a
brick yielded at last, and with trembling fingers
I detached it. Darkness within, yet beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
question there was a cavity there, not a solid
wall; and with infinite care we removed another
brick. Still the hole was too small to
admit enough light from the dimly illuminated
cell. With a chisel we pried at the sides of
a large block of masonry, perhaps eight bricks
in size. It moved, and we softly slid it from
its bed.</p>

<p>Valguanera, who was standing watching us
as we lowered the bricks to the floor, gave a
sudden cry, a cry like that of a frightened
woman,&mdash;terrible, coming from him. Yet there
was cause.</p>

<p>Framed by the ragged opening of the bricks,
hardly seen in the dim light, was a face, an
ivory image, more beautiful than any antique
bust, but drawn and distorted by unspeakable
agony: the lovely mouth half open, as though
gasping for breath; the eyes cast upward; and
below, slim chiselled hands crossed on the
breast, but clutching the folds of the white
Carmelite habit, torture and agony visible in
every tense muscle, fighting against the determination
of the rigid pose.</p>

<p>We stood there breathless, staring at the pitiful
sight, fascinated, bewitched. So this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the secret. With fiendish ingenuity, the rigid
ecclesiastics had blocked up the window, then
forced the beautiful creature to stand in the
alcove, while with remorseless hands and iron
hearts they had shut her into a living tomb. I
had read of such things in romance; but to find
the verity here, before my eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>Steps came down the cloister, and with a
simultaneous thought we sprang to the door
and closed it behind us. The room was sacred;
that awful sight was not for curious eyes. The
gardener was coming to ask some trivial question
of Valguanera. The Cavaliere cut him
short. "Pietro, go down to Parco and ask
Padre Stefano to come here at once." (I
thanked him with a glance.) "Stay!" He
turned to me: "Signore, it is already two
o'clock and too late for mass, is it not?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>Valguanera thought a moment, then he said,
"Bring two horses; the Signor Americano will
go with you,&mdash;do you understand?" Then,
turning to me, "You will go, will you not? I
think you can explain matters to Padre Stefano
better than I."</p>

<p>"Of course I will go, more than gladly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
So it happened that after a hasty luncheon I
wound down the mountain to Parco, found
Padre Stefano, explained my errand to him,
found him intensely eager and sympathetic,
and by five o'clock had him back at the convent
with all that was necessary for the resting
of the soul of the dead girl.</p>

<p>In the warm twilight, with the last light of
the sunset pouring into the little cell through
the window where almost a century ago Rosalia
had for the last time said farewell to her
lover, we gathered together to speed her tortured
soul on its journey, so long delayed.
Nothing was omitted; all the needful offices
of the Church were said by Padre Stefano,
while the light in the window died away, and
the flickering flames of the candles carried by
two of the acolytes from San Francesco threw
fitful flashes of pallid light into the dark recess
where the white face had prayed to Heaven for
a hundred years.</p>

<p>Finally, the Padre took the asperge from the
hands of one of the acolytes, and with a sign of
the cross in benediction while he chanted the
<i>Asperges</i>, gently sprinkled the holy water on
the upturned face. Instantly the whole vision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
crumbled to dust, the face was gone, and where
once the candlelight had flickered on the perfect
semblance of the girl dead so very long,
it now fell only on the rough bricks which
closed the window, bricks laid with frozen
hearts by pitiless hands.</p>

<p>But our task was not done yet. It had been
arranged that Padre Stefano should remain at
the convent all night, and that as soon as midnight
made it possible he should say the first
mass for the repose of the girl's soul. We sat
on the terrace talking over the strange events
of the last crowded hours, and I noted with
satisfaction that the Cavaliere no longer spoke
of the Church with that hardness, which had
hurt me so often. It is true that the Padre was
with us nearly all the time; but not only was
Valguanera courteous, he was almost sympathetic;
and I wondered if it might not prove
that more than one soul benefited by the untoward
events of the day.</p>

<p>With the aid of the astonished and delighted
servants, and no little help as well from Signora
Valguanera, I fitted up the long cold Altar in
the chapel, and by midnight we had the gloomy
sanctuary beautiful with flowers and candles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
It was a curiously solemn service, in the first
hour of the new day, in the midst of blazing
candles and the thick incense, the odor of the
opening orange-blooms drifting up in the fresh
morning air, and mingling with the incense
smoke and the perfume of flowers within.
Many prayers were said that night for the
soul of the dead girl, and I think many afterwards;
for after the benediction I remained for
a little time in my place, and when I rose from
my knees and went towards the chapel door,
I saw a figure kneeling still, and, with a start,
recognized the form of the Cavaliere. I smiled
with quiet satisfaction and gratitude, and went
away softly, content with the chain of events
that now seemed finished.</p>

<p>The next day the alcove was again walled up,
for the precious dust could not be gathered together
for transportation to consecrated ground;
so I went down to the little cemetery at Parco
for a basket of earth, which we cast in over the
ashes of Sister Maddelena.</p>

<p>By and by, when Rendel and I went away,
with great regret, Valguanera came down to
Palermo with us; and the last act that we performed
in Sicily was assisting him to order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a tablet of marble, whereon was carved this
simple inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="hd2">HERE LIES THE BODY OF<br />
ROSALIA DI CASTIGLIONI,<br />
CALLED<br />
SISTER MADDELENA.<br />
HER SOUL<br />
IS WITH HIM WHO GAVE IT.</div>

<p>To this I added in thought:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let him that is without sin among you cast
the first stone."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<h2>NOTRE DAME DES EAUX.</h2>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<h2><big>Notre Dame des Eaux.</big></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">West</span> of St. Pol de Leon, on the sea-cliffs of
Finisterre, stands the ancient church of Notre
Dame des Eaux. Five centuries of beating
winds and sweeping rains have moulded its
angles, and worn its carvings and sculpture
down to the very semblance of the ragged cliffs
themselves, until even the Breton fisherman,
looking lovingly from his boat as he makes for
the harbor of Morlaix, hardly can say where
the crags end, and where the church begins.
The teeth of the winds of the sea have devoured,
bit by bit, the fine sculpture of the
doorway and the thin cusps of the window
tracery; gray moss creeps caressingly over the
worn walls in ineffectual protection; gentle
vines, turned crabbed by the harsh beating of
the fierce winds, clutch the crumbling buttresses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
climb up over the sinking roof, reach
in even at the louvres of the belfry, holding the
little sanctuary safe in desperate arms against
the savage warfare of the sea and sky.</p>

<p>Many a time you may follow the rocky highway
from St. Pol even around the last land of
France, and so to Brest, yet never see sign of
Notre Dame des Eaux; for it clings to a cliff
somewhat lower than the road, and between
grows a stunted thicket of harsh and ragged
trees, their skeleton white branches, tortured
and contorted, thrusting sorrowfully out of the
hard, dark foliage that still grows below, where
the rise of land below the highway gives some
protection. You must leave the wood by the
two cottages of yellow stone, about twenty
miles beyond St. Pol, and go down to the right,
around the old stone quarry; then, bearing to
the left by the little cliff path, you will, in a
moment, see the pointed roof of the tower of
Notre Dame, and, later, come down to the side
porch among the crosses of the arid little graveyard.</p>

<p>It is worth the walk, for though the church
has outwardly little but its sad picturesqueness
to repay the artist, within it is a dream and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
delight. A Norman nave of round, red stone
piers and arches, a delicate choir of the richest
flamboyant, a High Altar of the time of Francis
I., form only the mellow background and frame
for carven tombs and dark old pictures, hanging
lamps of iron and brass, and black, heavily
carved choir-stalls of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>So has the little church lain unnoticed for
many centuries; for the horrors and follies of
the Revolution have never come near, and the
hardy and faithful people of Finisterre have
feared God and loved Our Lady too well to harm
her church. For many years it was the church
of the Comtes de Jarleuc; and these are their
tombs that mellow year by year under the warm
light of the painted windows, given long ago
by Comte Robert de Jarleuc, when the heir
of Poullaouen came safely to shore in the harbor
of Morlaix, having escaped from the Isle
of Wight, where he had lain captive after the
awful defeat of the fleet of Charles of Valois
at Sluys. And now the heir of Poullaouen lies
in a carven tomb, forgetful of the world where
he fought so nobly: the dynasty he fought to
establish, only a memory; the family he made
glorious, a name; the Ch&acirc;teau Poullaouen a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
single crag of riven masonry in the fields of
M. du Bois, mayor of Morlaix.</p>

<p>It was Julien, Comte de Bergerac, who rediscovered
Notre Dame des Eaux, and by his picture
of its dreamy interior in the Salon of '86
brought once more into notice this forgotten
corner of the world. The next year a party of
painters settled themselves near by, roughing it
as best they could, and in the year following,
Mme. de Bergerac and her daughter H&eacute;lo&iuml;se
came with Julien, and, buying the old farm of
Pontivy, on the highway over Notre Dame,
turned it into a summer house that almost
made amends for their lost ch&acirc;teau on the
Dordogne, stolen from them as virulent Royalists
by the triumphant Republic in 1794.</p>

<p>Little by little a summer colony of painters
gathered around Pontivy, and it was not until
the spring of 1890 that the peace of the colony
was broken. It was a sorrowful tragedy. Jean
d'Yriex, the youngest and merriest devil of all the
jolly crew, became suddenly moody and morose.
At first this was attributed to his undisguised
admiration for Mlle. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, and was looked
on as one of the vagaries of boyish passion; but
one day, while riding with M. de Bergerac, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
suddenly seized the bridle of Julien's horse,
wrenched it from his hand, and, turning his
own horse's head towards the cliffs, lashed the
terrified animals into a gallop straight towards
the brink. He was only thwarted in his mad
object by Julien, who with a quick blow sent
him headlong in the dry grass, and reined in
the terrified animals hardly a yard from the
cliffs. When this happened, and no word of explanation
was granted, only a sullen silence that
lasted for days, it became clear that poor Jean's
brain was wrong in some way. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se devoted
herself to him with infinite patience,&mdash;though she
felt no special affection for him, only pity,&mdash;and
while he was with her he seemed sane and
quiet. But at night some strange mania took
possession of him. If he had worked on his
Prix de Rome picture in the daytime, while
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se sat by him, reading aloud or singing a
little, no matter how good the work, it would
have vanished in the morning, and he would
again begin, only to erase his labor during
the night.</p>

<p>At last his growing insanity reached its
climax; and one day in Notre Dame, when he
had painted better than usual, he suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
stopped, seized a palette knife, and slashed the
great canvas in strips. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se sprang forward
to stop him, and in crazy fury he turned on her,
striking at her throat with the palette knife.
The thin steel snapped, and the white throat
showed only a scarlet scratch. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se, without
that ordinary terror that would crush most
women, grasped the thin wrists of the madman,
and, though he could easily have wrenched his
hands away, d'Yriex sank on his knees in a
passion of tears. He shut himself in his room
at Pontivy, refusing to see any one, walking for
hours up and down, fighting against growing
madness. Soon Dr. Charpentier came from
Paris, summoned by Mme. de Bergerac; and
after one short, forced interview, left at once
for Paris, taking M. d'Yriex with him.</p>

<p>A few days later came a letter for Mme. de
Bergerac, in which Dr. Charpentier confessed
that Jean had disappeared, that he had allowed
him too much liberty, owing to his apparent
calmness, and that when the train stopped at
Le Mans he had slipped from him and utterly
vanished.</p>

<p>During the summer, word came occasionally
that no trace had been found of the unhappy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
man, and at last the Pontivy colony realized that
the merry boy was dead. Had he lived he
<i>must</i> have been found, for the exertions of the
police were perfect; yet not the slightest trace
was discovered, and his lamentable death was
acknowledged, not only by Mme. de Bergerac
and Jean's family,&mdash;sorrowing for the death
of their first-born, away in the warm hills of
Loz&egrave;re,&mdash;but by Dr. Charpentier as well.</p>

<p>So the summer passed, and the autumn came,
and at last the cold rains of November&mdash;the
skirmish line of the advancing army of winter&mdash;drove
the colony back to Paris.</p>

<p>It was the last day at Pontivy, and Mlle.
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se had come down to Notre Dame for a
last look at the beautiful shrine, a last prayer
for the repose of the tortured soul of poor Jean
d'Yriex. The rains had ceased for a time, and
a warm stillness lay over the cliffs and on the
creeping sea, swaying and lapping around the
ragged shore. H&eacute;lo&iuml;se knelt very long before
the Altar of Our Lady of the Waters; and when
she finally rose, could not bring herself to leave
as yet that place of sorrowful beauty, all warm
and golden with the last light of the declining
sun. She watched the old verger, Pierre Polou,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
stumping softly around the darkening building,
and spoke to him once, asking the hour;
but he was very deaf, as well as nearly blind,
and he did not answer.</p>

<p>So she sat in the corner of the aisle by the
Altar of Our Lady of the Waters, watching the
checkered light fade in the advancing shadows,
dreaming sad day-dreams of the dead summer,
until the day-dreams merged in night-dreams,
and she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Then the last light of the early sunset died
in the gleaming quarries of the west window;
Pierre Polou stumbled uncertainly through the
dusky shadow, locked the sagging doors of the
mouldering south porch, and took his way
among the leaning crosses up to the highway
and his little cottage, a good mile away,&mdash;the
nearest house to the lonely Church of Notre
Dame des Eaux.</p>

<p>With the setting of the sun great clouds rose
swiftly from the sea; the wind freshened, and
the gaunt branches of the weather-worn trees
in the churchyard lashed themselves beseechingly
before the coming storm. The tide turned,
and the waters at the foot of the rocks swept
uneasily up the narrow beach and caught at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
weary cliffs, their sobbing growing and deepening
to a threatening, solemn roar. Whirls of
dead leaves rose in the churchyard, and threw
themselves against the blank windows. The
winter and the night came down together.</p>

<p>H&eacute;lo&iuml;se awoke, bewildered and wondering;
in a moment she realized the situation, and without
fear or uneasiness. There was nothing to
dread in Notre Dame by night; the ghosts, if
there were ghosts, would not trouble her, and
the doors were securely locked. It was foolish
of her to fall asleep, and her mother would be
most uneasy at Pontivy if she realized before
dawn that H&eacute;lo&iuml;se had not returned. On the
other hand, she was in the habit of wandering
off to walk after dinner, often not coming home
until late, so it was quite possible that she
might return before Madame knew of her
absence, for Polou came always to unlock the
church for the low mass at six o'clock; so she
arose from her cramped position in the aisle,
and walked slowly up to the choir-rail, entered
the chancel, and felt her way to one of the
stalls, on the south side, where there were
cushions and an easy back.</p>

<p>It was really very beautiful in Notre Dame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
by night; she had never suspected how strange
and solemn the little church could be when the
moon shone fitfully through the south windows,
now bright and clear, now blotted out by sweeping
clouds. The nave was barred with the long
shadows of the heavy pillars, and when the
moon came out she could see far down almost
to the west end. How still it was! Only a
soft low murmur without of the restless limbs
of the trees, and of the creeping sea.</p>

<p>It was very soothing, almost like a song; and
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se felt sleep coming back to her as the
clouds shut out the moon, and all the church
grew black.</p>

<p>She was drifting off into the last delicious
moment of vanishing consciousness, when she
suddenly came fully awake, with a shock that
made every nerve tingle. In the midst of the
far faint sounds of the tempestuous night she
had heard a footstep! Yet the church was
utterly empty, she was sure. And again! A
footstep dragging and uncertain, stealthy and
cautious, but an unmistakable step, away in
the blackest shadow at the end of the church.</p>

<p>She sat up, frozen with the fear that comes
at night and that is overwhelming, her hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
clutching the coarse carving of the arms of the
stall, staring down into the dark.</p>

<p>Again the footstep, and again,&mdash;slow, measured,
one after another at intervals of perhaps
half a minute, growing a little louder each time,
a little nearer.</p>

<p>Would the darkness never be broken?
Would the cloud never pass? Minute after
minute went like weary hours, and still the
moon was hid, still the dead branches rattled
clatteringly on the high windows. Unconsciously
she moved, as under a magician's spell,
down to the choir-rail, straining her eyes to
pierce the thick night. And the step, it was
very near! Ah, the moon at last! A white ray
fell through the westernmost window, painting
a bar of light on the floor of sagging stone.
Then a second bar, then a third, and a fourth,
and for a moment H&eacute;lo&iuml;se could have cried out
with relief, for nothing broke the lines of light,&mdash;no
figure, no shadow. In another moment came
a step, and from the shadow of the last column
appeared in the pallid moonlight the figure of a
man. The girl stared breathless, the moonlight
falling on her as she stood rigid against
the low parapet. Another step and another,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and she saw before her&mdash;was it ghost or living
man?&mdash;a white mad face staring from matted
hair and beard, a tall thin figure half clothed in
rags, limping as it stepped towards her with
wounded feet. From the dead face stared mad
eyes that gleamed like the eyes of a cat, fixed
on hers with insane persistence, holding her,
fascinating her as a cat fascinates a bird.</p>

<p>One more step,&mdash;it was close before her now!
those awful, luminous eyes dilating and contracting
in awful palpitations. And the moon was
going out; the shadows swept one by one over the
windows; she stared at the moonlit face for a last
fascinated glance&mdash;Mother of God! it was&mdash;&mdash; The
shadow swept over them, and now only remained
the blazing eyes and the dim outline of
a form that crouched waveringly before her as
a cat crouches, drawing its vibrating body together
for the spring that blots out the life of
the victim.</p>

<p>In another instant the mad thing would leap;
but just as the quiver swept over the crouching
body, H&eacute;lo&iuml;se gathered all her strength into one
action of desperate terror.</p>

<p>"Jean, stop!"</p>

<p>The thing crouched before her paused, chattering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
softly to itself; then it articulated dryly,
and with all the trouble of a learning child,
the one word, "<i>Chantez!</i>"</p>

<p>Without a thought, H&eacute;lo&iuml;se sang; it was the
first thing that she remembered, an old Proven&ccedil;al
song that d'Yriex had always loved. While
she sang, the poor mad creature lay huddled at
her feet, separated from her only by the choir
parapet, its dilating, contracting eyes never moving
for an instant. As the song died away, came
again that awful tremor, indicative of the coming
death-spring, and again she sang,&mdash;this time
the old <i>Pange lingua</i>, its sonorous Latin sounding
in the deserted church like the voice of dead
centuries.</p>

<p>And so she sang, on and on, hour after hour,&mdash;hymns
and <i>chansons</i>, folk-songs and bits from
comic operas, songs of the boulevards alternating
with the <i>Tantum ergo</i> and the <i>O Filii et
Fili&aelig;</i>. It mattered little what she sang. At
last it seemed to her that it mattered little
whether she sang or no; for her brain whirled
round and round like a dizzy maelstrom, her
icy hands, griping the hard rail, alone supported
her dying body. She could hear no sound of her
song; her body was numb, her mouth parched,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
her lips cracked and bleeding; she felt the drops
of blood fall from her chin. And still she sang,
with the yellow palpitating eyes holding her as
in a vice. If only she could continue until dawn!
It must be dawn so soon! The windows were
growing gray, the rain lashed outside, she
could distinguish the features of the horror
before her; but the night of death was growing
with the coming day, blackness swept down
upon her; she could sing no more, her tortured
lips made one last effort to form the
words, "Mother of God, save me!" and night
and death came down like a crushing wave.</p>

<p>But her prayer was heard; the dawn had
come, and Polou unlocked the porch-door for
Father Augustin just in time to hear the last
agonized cry. The maniac turned in the very
act of leaping on his victim, and sprang for
the two men, who stopped in dumb amazement.
Poor old Pierre Polou went down at a
blow; but Father Augustin was young and
fearless, and he grappled the mad animal with all
his strength and will. It would have gone ill
even with him,&mdash;for no one can stand against
the bestial fury of a man in whom reason is
dead,&mdash;had not some sudden impulse seized the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
maniac, who pitched the priest aside with a
single movement, and, leaping through the door,
vanished forever.</p>

<p>Did he hurl himself from the cliffs in the
cold wet morning, or was he doomed to wander,
a wild beast, until, captured, he beat himself
in vain against the walls of some asylum, an unknown
pauper lunatic? None ever knew.</p>

<p>The colony at Pontivy was blotted out by
the dreary tragedy, and Notre Dame des Eaux
sank once more into silence and solitude. Once
a year Father Augustin said mass for the repose
of the soul of Jean d'Yriex; but no other memory
remained of the horror that blighted the lives of
an innocent girl and of a gray-haired mother
mourning for her dead boy in far Loz&egrave;re.</p>

<h2>THE DEAD VALLEY.</h2>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<h2><big>The Dead Valley.</big></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> a friend, Olof Ehrensv&auml;rd, a Swede by
birth, who yet, by reason of a strange and melancholy
mischance of his early boyhood, has thrown
his lot with that of the New World. It is a
curious story of a headstrong boy and a proud
and relentless family: the details do not matter
here, but they are sufficient to weave a web of
romance around the tall yellow-bearded man
with the sad eyes and the voice that gives itself
perfectly to plaintive little Swedish songs remembered
out of childhood. In the winter evenings
we play chess together, he and I, and after some
close, fierce battle has been fought to a finish&mdash;usually
with my own defeat&mdash;we fill our pipes
again, and Ehrensv&auml;rd tells me stories of the
far, half-remembered days in the fatherland,
before he went to sea: stories that grow very
strange and incredible as the night deepens and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the fire falls together, but stories that, nevertheless,
I fully believe.</p>

<p>One of them made a strong impression on me,
so I set it down here, only regretting that I cannot
reproduce the curiously perfect English and
the delicate accent which to me increased the
fascination of the tale. Yet, as best I can remember
it, here it is.</p>

<p>"I never told you how Nils and I went over
the hills to Hallsberg, and how we found the
Dead Valley, did I? Well, this is the way it
happened. I must have been about twelve
years old, and Nils Sj&ouml;berg, whose father's estate
joined ours, was a few months younger.
We were inseparable just at that time, and
whatever we did, we did together.</p>

<p>"Once a week it was market day in Engelholm,
and Nils and I went always there to see
the strange sights that the market gathered
from all the surrounding country. One day we
quite lost our hearts, for an old man from across
the Elfborg had brought a little dog to sell,
that seemed to us the most beautiful dog in all
the world. He was a round, woolly puppy, so
funny that Nils and I sat down on the ground
and laughed at him, until he came and played<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
with us in so jolly a way that we felt that there
was only one really desirable thing in life, and
that was the little dog of the old man from
across the hills. But alas! we had not half
money enough wherewith to buy him, so we
were forced to beg the old man not to sell him
before the next market day, promising that we
would bring the money for him then. He gave
us his word, and we ran home very fast and implored
our mothers to give us money for the
little dog.</p>

<p>"We got the money, but we could not wait
for the next market day. Suppose the puppy
should be sold! The thought frightened us so
that we begged and implored that we might be
allowed to go over the hills to Hallsberg where
the old man lived, and get the little dog ourselves,
and at last they told us we might go.
By starting early in the morning we should
reach Hallsberg by three o'clock, and it was
arranged that we should stay there that night
with Nils's aunt, and, leaving by noon the next
day, be home again by sunset.</p>

<p>"Soon after sunrise we were on our way, after
having received minute instructions as to just
what we should do in all possible and impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
circumstances, and finally a repeated injunction
that we should start for home at the same hour
the next day, so that we might get safely back
before nightfall.</p>

<p>"For us, it was magnificent sport, and we
started off with our rifles, full of the sense of
our very great importance: yet the journey was
simple enough, along a good road, across the
big hills we knew so well, for Nils and I had
shot over half the territory this side of the dividing
ridge of the Elfborg. Back of Engelholm
lay a long valley, from which rose the low
mountains, and we had to cross this, and then
follow the road along the side of the hills for
three or four miles, before a narrow path
branched off to the left, leading up through
the pass.</p>

<p>"Nothing occurred of interest on the way
over, and we reached Hallsberg in due season,
found to our inexpressible joy that the little dog
was not sold, secured him, and so went to the
house of Nils's aunt to spend the night.</p>

<p>"Why we did not leave early on the following
day, I can't quite remember; at all events, I
know we stopped at a shooting range just outside
of the town, where most attractive pasteboard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
pigs were sliding slowly through painted
foliage, serving so as beautiful marks. The
result was that we did not get fairly started for
home until afternoon, and as we found ourselves
at last pushing up the side of the mountain
with the sun dangerously near their summits, I
think we were a little scared at the prospect of
the examination and possible punishment that
awaited us when we got home at midnight.</p>

<p>"Therefore we hurried as fast as possible up
the mountain side, while the blue dusk closed in
about us, and the light died in the purple sky.
At first we had talked hilariously, and the little
dog had leaped ahead of us with the utmost
joy. Latterly, however, a curious oppression
came on us; we did not speak or even whistle,
while the dog fell behind, following us with hesitation
in every muscle.</p>

<p>"We had passed through the foothills and
the low spurs of the mountains, and were almost
at the top of the main range, when life
seemed to go out of everything, leaving the
world dead, so suddenly silent the forest became,
so stagnant the air. Instinctively we halted to
listen.</p>

<p>"Perfect silence,&mdash;the crushing silence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
deep forests at night; and more, for always,
even in the most impenetrable fastnesses of the
wooded mountains, is the multitudinous murmur
of little lives, awakened by the darkness, exaggerated
and intensified by the stillness of the
air and the great dark: but here and now the
silence seemed unbroken even by the turn of a
leaf, the movement of a twig, the note of night
bird or insect. I could hear the blood beat
through my veins; and the crushing of the
grass under our feet as we advanced with hesitating
steps sounded like the falling of trees.</p>

<p>"And the air was stagnant,&mdash;dead. The
atmosphere seemed to lie upon the body like
the weight of sea on a diver who has ventured
too far into its awful depths. What we usually
call silence seems so only in relation to the din of
ordinary experience. This was silence in the
absolute, and it crushed the mind while it
intensified the senses, bringing down the awful
weight of inextinguishable fear.</p>

<p>"I know that Nils and I stared towards each
other in abject terror, listening to our quick,
heavy breathing, that sounded to our acute
senses like the fitful rush of waters. And the
poor little dog we were leading justified our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
terror. The black oppression seemed to crush
him even as it did us. He lay close on the
ground, moaning feebly, and dragging himself
painfully and slowly closer to Nils's feet. I
think this exhibition of utter animal fear was
the last touch, and must inevitably have blasted
our reason&mdash;mine anyway; but just then, as we
stood quaking on the bounds of madness, came
a sound, so awful, so ghastly, so horrible, that
it seemed to rouse us from the dead spell that
was on us.</p>

<p>"In the depth of the silence came a cry,
beginning as a low, sorrowful moan, rising to a
tremulous shriek, culminating in a yell that
seemed to tear the night in sunder and rend the
world as by a cataclysm. So fearful was it
that I could not believe it had actual existence:
it passed previous experience, the powers of
belief, and for a moment I thought it the result
of my own animal terror, an hallucination born
of tottering reason.</p>

<p>"A glance at Nils dispelled this thought in a
flash. In the pale light of the high stars he
was the embodiment of all possible human fear,
quaking with an ague, his jaw fallen, his tongue
out, his eyes protruding like those of a hanged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
man. Without a word we fled, the panic of
fear giving us strength, and together, the little
dog caught close in Nils's arms, we sped down
the side of the cursed mountains,&mdash;anywhere,
goal was of no account: we had but one impulse&mdash;to
get away from that place.</p>

<p>"So under the black trees and the far white
stars that flashed through the still leaves overhead,
we leaped down the mountain side, regardless
of path or landmark, straight through
the tangled underbrush, across mountain
streams, through fens and copses, anywhere,
so only that our course was downward.</p>

<p>"How long we ran thus, I have no idea,
but by and by the forest fell behind, and we
found ourselves among the foothills, and fell
exhausted on the dry short grass, panting like
tired dogs.</p>

<p>"It was lighter here in the open, and presently
we looked around to see where we were, and
how we were to strike out in order to find the
path that would lead us home. We looked
in vain for a familiar sign. Behind us rose the
great wall of black forest on the flank of the
mountain: before us lay the undulating mounds
of low foothills, unbroken by trees or rocks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and beyond, only the fall of black sky bright
with multitudinous stars that turned its velvet
depth to a luminous gray.</p>

<p>"As I remember, we did not speak to each
other once: the terror was too heavy on us for
that, but by and by we rose simultaneously and
started out across the hills.</p>

<p>"Still the same silence, the same dead,
motionless air&mdash;air that was at once sultry
and chilling: a heavy heat struck through with
an icy chill that felt almost like the burning
of frozen steel. Still carrying the helpless
dog, Nils pressed on through the hills, and I
followed close behind. At last, in front of us,
rose a slope of moor touching the white stars.
We climbed it wearily, reached the top, and
found ourselves gazing down into a great,
smooth valley, filled half way to the brim with&mdash;what?</p>

<p>"As far as the eye could see stretched a level
plain of ashy white, faintly phosphorescent, a
sea of velvet fog that lay like motionless water,
or rather like a floor of alabaster, so dense did
it appear, so seemingly capable of sustaining
weight. If it were possible, I think that sea of
dead white mist struck even greater terror into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
my soul than the heavy silence or the deadly
cry&mdash;so ominous was it, so utterly unreal, so
phantasmal, so impossible, as it lay there like a
dead ocean under the steady stars. Yet through
that mist <i>we must go</i>! there seemed no other
way home, and, shattered with abject fear, mad
with the one desire to get back, we started
down the slope to where the sea of milky mist
ceased, sharp and distinct around the stems of
the rough grass.</p>

<p>"I put one foot into the ghostly fog. A chill
as of death struck through me, stopping my
heart, and I threw myself backward on the
slope. At that instant came again the shriek,
close, close, right in our ears, in ourselves, and
far out across that damnable sea I saw the cold
fog lift like a water-spout and toss itself high in
writhing convolutions towards the sky. The
stars began to grow dim as thick vapor swept
across them, and in the growing dark I saw a
great, watery moon lift itself slowly above the
palpitating sea, vast and vague in the gathering
mist.</p>

<p>"This was enough: we turned and fled along
the margin of the white sea that throbbed now
with fitful motion below us, rising, rising, slowly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and steadily, driving us higher and higher up
the side of the foothills.</p>

<p>"It was a race for life; that we knew. How
we kept it up I cannot understand, but we did,
and at last we saw the white sea fall behind us
as we staggered up the end of the valley, and
then down into a region that we knew, and so
into the old path. The last thing I remember
was hearing a strange voice, that of Nils, but
horribly changed, stammer brokenly, 'The dog
is dead!' and then the whole world turned
around twice, slowly and resistlessly, and consciousness
went out with a crash.</p>

<p>"It was some three weeks later, as I remember,
that I awoke in my own room, and found
my mother sitting beside the bed. I could not
think very well at first, but as I slowly grew
strong again, vague flashes of recollection began
to come to me, and little by little the whole sequence
of events of that awful night in the
Dead Valley came back. All that I could gain
from what was told me was that three weeks
before I had been found in my own bed, raging
sick, and that my illness grew fast into brain
fever. I tried to speak of the dread things that
had happened to me, but I saw at once that no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
one looked on them save as the hauntings of a
dying frenzy, and so I closed my mouth and
kept my own counsel.</p>

<p>"I must see Nils, however, and so I asked
for him. My mother told me that he also had
been ill with a strange fever, but that he was
now quite well again. Presently they brought
him in, and when we were alone I began to
speak to him of the night on the mountain. I
shall never forget the shock that struck me
down on my pillow when the boy denied everything:
denied having gone with me, ever having
heard the cry, having seen the valley, or
feeling the deadly chill of the ghostly fog.
Nothing would shake his determined ignorance,
and in spite of myself I was forced to admit
that his denials came from no policy of concealment,
but from blank oblivion.</p>

<p>"My weakened brain was in a turmoil. Was
it all but the floating phantasm of delirium? Or
had the horror of the real thing blotted Nils's
mind into blankness so far as the events of the
night in the Dead Valley were concerned? The
latter explanation seemed the only one, else how
explain the sudden illness which in a night had
struck us both down? I said nothing more,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
either to Nils or to my own people, but waited,
with a growing determination that, once well
again, I would find that valley if it really
existed.</p>

<p>"It was some weeks before I was really well
enough to go, but finally, late in September, I
chose a bright, warm, still day, the last smile of
the dying summer, and started early in the morning
along the path that led to Hallsberg. I was
sure I knew where the trail struck off to the
right, down which we had come from the valley
of dead water, for a great tree grew by the
Hallsberg path at the point where, with a sense
of salvation, we had found the home road.
Presently I saw it to the right, a little distance
ahead.</p>

<p>"I think the bright sunlight and the clear air
had worked as a tonic to me, for by the time I
came to the foot of the great pine, I had quite
lost faith in the verity of the vision that haunted
me, believing at last that it was indeed but the
nightmare of madness. Nevertheless, I turned
sharply to the right, at the base of the tree, into
a narrow path that led through a dense thicket.
As I did so I tripped over something. A swarm
of flies sung into the air around me, and looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
down I saw the matted fleece, with the poor
little bones thrusting through, of the dog we
had bought in Hallsberg.</p>

<p>"Then my courage went out with a puff, and
I knew that it all was true, and that now I was
frightened. Pride and the desire for adventure
urged me on, however, and I pressed into the
close thicket that barred my way. The path
was hardly visible: merely the worn road of
some small beasts, for, though it showed in the
crisp grass, the bushes above grew thick and
hardly penetrable. The land rose slowly, and
rising grew clearer, until at last I came out on a
great slope of hill, unbroken by trees or shrubs,
very like my memory of that rise of land we had
topped in order that we might find the dead valley
and the icy fog. I looked at the sun; it was
bright and clear, and all around insects were
humming in the autumn air, and birds were
darting to and fro. Surely there was no danger,
not until nightfall at least; so I began to whistle,
and with a rush mounted the last crest of brown
hill.</p>

<p>"There lay the Dead Valley! A great oval
basin, almost as smooth and regular as though
made by man. On all sides the grass crept over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the brink of the encircling hills, dusty green on
the crests, then fading into ashy brown, and so
to a deadly white, this last color forming a thin
ring, running in a long line around the slope.
And then? Nothing. Bare, brown, hard earth,
glittering with grains of alkali, but otherwise
dead and barren. Not a tuft of grass, not a
stick of brushwood, not even a stone, but only
the vast expanse of beaten clay.</p>

<p>"In the midst of the basin, perhaps a mile
and a half away, the level expanse was broken
by a great dead tree, rising leafless and gaunt
into the air. Without a moment's hesitation I
started down into the valley and made for this
goal. Every particle of fear seemed to have
left me, and even the valley itself did not look
so very terrifying. At all events, I was driven
by an overwhelming curiosity, and there seemed
to be but one thing in the world to do,&mdash;to get
to that Tree! As I trudged along over the
hard earth, I noticed that the multitudinous
voices of birds and insects had died away. No
bee or butterfly hovered through the air, no
insects leaped or crept over the dull earth. The
very air itself was stagnant.</p>

<p>"As I drew near the skeleton tree, I noticed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the glint of sunlight on a kind of white mound
around its roots, and I wondered curiously. It
was not until I had come close that I saw its
nature.</p>

<p>"All around the roots and barkless trunk
was heaped a wilderness of little bones. Tiny
skulls of rodents and of birds, thousands of
them, rising about the dead tree and streaming
off for several yards in all directions, until the
dreadful pile ended in isolated skulls and scattered
skeletons. Here and there a larger bone
appeared,&mdash;the thigh of a sheep, the hoofs of
a horse, and to one side, grinning slowly, a
human skull.</p>

<p>"I stood quite still, staring with all my eyes,
when suddenly the dense silence was broken by
a faint, forlorn cry high over my head. I looked
up and saw a great falcon turning and sailing
downward just over the tree. In a moment more
she fell motionless on the bleaching bones.</p>

<p>"Horror struck me, and I rushed for home,
my brain whirling, a strange numbness growing
in me. I ran steadily, on and on. At last I
glanced up. Where was the rise of hill? I
looked around wildly. Close before me was the
dead tree with its pile of bones. I had circled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
it round and round, and the valley wall was still
a mile and a half away.</p>

<p>"I stood dazed and frozen. The sun was
sinking, red and dull, towards the line of hills.
In the east the dark was growing fast. Was
there still time? <i>Time!</i> It was not <i>that</i> I
wanted, it was <i>will</i>! My feet seemed clogged
as in a nightmare. I could hardly drag them
over the barren earth. And then I felt the slow
chill creeping through me. I looked down.
Out of the earth a thin mist was rising, collecting
in little pools that grew ever larger until
they joined here and there, their currents swirling
slowly like thin blue smoke. The western
hills halved the copper sun. When it was dark
I should hear that shriek again, and then I should
die. I knew that, and with every remaining
atom of will I staggered towards the red west
through the writhing mist that crept clammily
around my ankles, retarding my steps.</p>

<p>"And as I fought my way off from the Tree,
the horror grew, until at last I thought I was
going to die. The silence pursued me like dumb
ghosts, the still air held my breath, the hellish
fog caught at my feet like cold hands.</p>

<p>"But I won! though not a moment too soon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
As I crawled on my hands and knees up the
brown slope, I heard, far away and high in the
air, the cry that already had almost bereft me
of reason. It was faint and vague, but unmistakable
in its horrible intensity. I glanced behind.
The fog was dense and pallid, heaving
undulously up the brown slope. The sky was
gold under the setting sun, but below was the
ashy gray of death. I stood for a moment on
the brink of this sea of hell, and then leaped
down the slope. The sunset opened before
me, the night closed behind, and as I crawled
home weak and tired, darkness shut down on
the Dead Valley."</p>

<h2>POSTSCRIPT.</h2>

<p>There seem to be certain well-defined roots
existing in all countries, from which spring
the current legends of the supernatural; and
therefore for the germs of the stories in this
book the Author claims no originality. These
legends differ one from the other only in local
color and in individual treatment. If the Author
has succeeded in clothing one or two of these
norms in some slightly new vesture, he is more
than content.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">The Complete Works of Edgar Allan
Poe.</span> Newly collected, edited, and for the
first time revised after the author's final manuscript
corrections, by Edmund Clarence Stedman
and George Edward Woodberry, with many
portraits, fac-similes, and pictures by Albert
Edward Sterner.</p>

<p class="p3">This is the only complete edition of Poe's
works. The entire writings have been revised;
innumerable errors have been corrected; quotations
have been verified, and the work now
stands&mdash;for the first time&mdash;as Poe wished it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
stand. The editors contribute a memoir, critical
introduction, and notes; the variorum texts are
given and new matter has been added. The
portraits include several which have never appeared
in book form before, and the printing has
been carefully done at the University Press in
Cambridge on specially made, deckled edge
paper.</p>

<p class="p3">In fine, the edition aims to be definitive, and
is intended alike for the librarian, the student,
and the book-lover.</p>

<p class="p3">In ten volumes, price $15.00, net, a set; or
separately, $1.50, net, per volume.</p>

<p class="p3">The large-paper edition, limited to 250 numbered
sets for America, contains a series of
illustrations to the tales by Aubrey Beardsley,
and a signed etching by Mr. Sterner,&mdash;not
included in the small-paper edition,&mdash;proofs
of all the pictures printed on India paper, and,
in truth, is a luxurious edition. On handsome
paper, octavo. Price, $50.00, net. Sold only in
sets; numbers will be assigned as the orders are
received.</p>
